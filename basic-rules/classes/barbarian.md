# บาบาเรียน Barbarian

มนุษย์ชาวเผ่าสูงใหญ่เดินฝ่าพายุหิมะ ร่างคลุมด้วยขนสัตว์และแบกขวานของเขา เขาหัวเราะเสียงดังในขณะที่พุ่งเข้าปะทะกับยักษ์น้ำแข็งที่กล้ามายุ่มย่ามกับฝูงกวางเอลค์สมบัติของเผ่า

ฮาล์ฟออร์คคำรามใส่คู่ต่อสู้คนล่าสุดที่กล้ามาท้าชิงอำนาจในเผ่าของเธอ พร้อมเต็มที่ที่จะหักคอมันด้วยมือเปล่าเหมือนกับที่ 6 คนที่แล้วโดนไป

ด้วยความเมามันน้ำลายแตกฟอง ดวอร์ฟฟาดหมวกเหล็กของเขาเข้าที่หน้าของศัตรูชาวดราว และหันไปพุ่งศอกใส่เข้าท้องของอีกคนอย่างจัง

คนเถื่อนเหล่านี้ แม้แตกต่างกันตามแต่จะเป็น ก็ถูกกำหนดด้วยความคลั่งของพวกเขา: ไร้การควบคุม ความโกรธที่ยากจะดับ และความเดือดดาลไร้การควบคุม มันมากกว่าแค่อารมณ์ ความโกรธของพวกเขาเป็นดั่งความดุร้ายของสัตว์นักล่าที่จนมุม เป็นความรุนแรงเหมือนพายุ ถาโถมดั่งคลื่นทะเลคลั่ง

กับบางคน ความคลั่งเกิดจากการเชื่อมต่อกับวิญญาณสัตว์ร้าย และบางคนดึงพลังมาจากความโกรธแค้นต่อโลกที่มีแต่ความเจ็บปวด สำหรับบาบาเรียนทุกคน ความคลั่ง (rage) เป็นพลังที่เป็นเชื้อไฟไม่ใช่แค่ความรุนแรงในการต่อสู้แต่ยังใช้ในการตอบสนอง ความอดทน และเพิ่มความแข็งแกร่ง

## Primal Instinct

People of towns and cities take pride in their settled ways, as if denying one’s connection to nature were a mark of superiority. To a barbarian, though, a settled life is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace nature—valuing keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Barbarians are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands: the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes live and hunt.

Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.

## A Life of Danger

A barbarian plays an important role as a protector of their people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger so that their people don’t have to.

Their courage in the face of danger makes barbarians perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Some barbarians miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties.

## Creating a Barbarian

When creating a barbarian character, think about where your character comes from and his or her place in the world. Talk with your DM about an appropriate origin for your barbarian. Did you come from a distant land, making you a stranger in the area of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier where barbarians are common?

What led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled lands by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to another land and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you committed, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.

### Quick Build

You can make a barbarian quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Strength, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the outlander background.

## Class Features

As a barbarian, you gain the following class features.

### Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d12 per barbarian level

**Weapons:** Simple weapons, martial weapons

**Tools:** None

**Saving Throws:** Strength, Constitution

**Skills:** Choose two from [Animal Handling](../ch07-using-ability-scores.md#ทักษะการจัดการสัตว์-animal-handling), [Athletics](../ch07-using-ability-scores.md#ทักษะทางกรีฑา-athletics), [Intimidation](../ch07-using-ability-scores.md#ทักษะการข่มขู่-intimidation), [Nature](../ch07-using-ability-scores.md#ทักษะความรู้ทางธรรมชาติ-nature-เนเจอร์), [Perception](../ch07-using-ability-scores.md#ทักษะการรับรู้-perception), and [Survival](../ch07-using-ability-scores.md#ทักษะการเอาตัวรอด-survival)

### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- (a) a [greataxe]() or (b) any martial melee weapon
- (a) two [handaxes]() or (b) any simple weapon
- An [explorer’s pack]() and four [javelins]()

### Rage {#Rage}

In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.

While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:

- You have [advantage](../ch07-using-ability-scores.md#การทอยแบบได้เปรียบ-advantage-แอดแวนเทจ-และการทอยแบบเสียเปรียบ-disadvantage-ดิสแอดแวนเทจ) on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
- When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.
- You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked [unconscious](../appendice-a-condition.md#unconscious) or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.

Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.

### Unarmored Defense {#UnarmoredDefense}

While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

### Reckless Attack {#RecklessAttack}

Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you [advantage](../ch07-using-ability-scores.md#การทอยแบบได้เปรียบ-advantage-แอดแวนเทจ-และการทอยแบบเสียเปรียบ-disadvantage-ดิสแอดแวนเทจ) on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have [advantage](../ch07-using-ability-scores.md#การทอยแบบได้เปรียบ-advantage-แอดแวนเทจ-และการทอยแบบเสียเปรียบ-disadvantage-ดิสแอดแวนเทจ) until your next turn.

### Danger Sense {#DangerSense}

At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.

You have [advantage](../ch07-using-ability-scores.md#การทอยแบบได้เปรียบ-advantage-แอดแวนเทจ-และการทอยแบบเสียเปรียบ-disadvantage-ดิสแอดแวนเทจ) on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be [blinded](), [deafened](), or [incapacitated]().

### Primal Path {#PrimalPath}

At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the [Path of the Berserker](#PathoftheBerserker) or the [Path of the Totem Warrior](#PathoftheTotemWarrior), both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.

### Ability Score Improvement {#AbilityScoreImprovement}

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack {#ExtraAttack}

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the [Attack]() action on your turn.

### Fast Movement {#FastMovement}

Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor.

### Feral Instinct {#FeralInstinct}

By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.

Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t [incapacitated](), you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.

### Brutal Critical {#BrutalCritical}

Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.

### Relentless Rage {#RelentlessRage}

Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.

### Persistent Rage {#PersistentRage}

Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall [unconscious]() or if you choose to end it.

### Indomitable Might {#IndomitableMight}

Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

### Primal Champion {#PrimalChampion}

At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.

## Primal Paths {#PrimalPaths}

Rage burns in every barbarian’s heart, a furnace that drives him or her toward greatness. Different barbarians attribute their rage to different sources, however. For some, it is an internal reservoir where pain, grief, and anger are forged into a fury hard as steel. Others see it as a spiritual blessing, a gift of a totem animal.

### Path of the Berserker {#PathoftheBerserker}

For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end — that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker’s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.

#### Frenzy {#Frenzy}

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of [exhaustion]() (as described in [appendix A]).

#### Mindless Rage {#MindlessRage}

Beginning at 6th level, you can’t be [charmed]() or [frightened]() while raging. If you are [charmed]() or [frightened]() when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.

#### Intimidating Presence {#IntimidatingPresence}

Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be [frightened]() of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the [frightened]() creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.

If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can’t use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.

#### Retaliation {#Retaliation}

Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.

### Path of the Totem Warrior {#PathoftheTotemWarrior}

The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your barbarian rage.

In some barbarians’ tribes, a totem animal is considered to be kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit, though exceptions exist.

#### Spirit Seeker {#SpiritSeeker}

Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural world, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the [beast sense]() and [speak with animals]() spells, but only as rituals, as described in chapter 10, “[Spellcasting]().”

#### Totem Spirit {#TotemSpirit}

At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object — an amulet or similar adornment — that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.

Your totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in place of an eagle.

**_Bear._** While raging, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage. The spirit of the bear makes you tough enough to stand up to any punishment.

**_Eagle._** While you’re raging, other creatures have [disadvantage]() on opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn. The spirit of the eagle makes you into a predator who can weave through the fray with ease.

**_Wolf._** While you’re raging, your friends have [advantage]() on melee attack rolls against any creature within 5 feet of you that is hostile to you. The spirit of the wolf makes you a leader of hunters.

#### Aspect of the Beast {#AspectoftheBeast}

At 6th level, you gain a magical benefit based on the totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected at 3rd level or a different one.

**_Bear._** You gain the might of a bear. Your carrying capacity (including maximum load and maximum lift) is doubled, and you have [advantage]() on Strength checks made to push, pull, lift, or break objects.

**_Eagle._** You gain the eyesight of an eagle. You can see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty, able to discern even fine details as though looking at something no more than 100 feet away from you. Additionally, dim light doesn’t impose disadvantage on your Wisdom ([Perception]()) checks.

**_Wolf._** You gain the hunting sensibilities of a wolf. You can track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace, and you can move stealthily while traveling at a normal pace (see chapter 8, [“Adventuring](),” for rules on travel pace).

#### Spirit Walker {#SpiritWalker}

At 10th level, you can cast the [commune with nature]() spell, but only as a ritual. When you do so, a spiritual version of one of the animals you chose for Totem Spirit or Aspect of the Beast appears to you to convey the information you seek.

#### Totemic Attunement {#TotemicAttunement}

At 14th level, you gain a magical benefit based on a totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected previously or a different one.

**_Bear._** While you’re raging, any creature within 5 feet of you that’s hostile to you has [disadvantage]() on attack rolls against targets other than you or another character with this feature. An enemy is immune to this effect if it can’t see or hear you or if it can’t be [frightened]().

**_Eagle._** While raging, you have a [flying]() speed equal to your current walking speed. This benefit works only in short bursts; you fall if you end your turn in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft.

**_Wolf._** While you’re raging, you can use a bonus action on your turn to knock a Large or smaller creature [prone]() when you hit it with melee weapon attack.
