# Peril in Pinebrook

An Introductory Adventure for The World’s Greatest Roleplaying Game

# Welcome to Dungeons & Dragons: Peril in Pinebrook

Welcome to the adventure of a lifetime!

Peril in Pinebrook is an introductory Dungeons & Dragons (also known as D&D) adventure designed for younger players, but it can be enjoyed by players of all ages!

Peril in Pinebrook contains four ready-to-play characters that you can use to run your first D&D game. The simplified rules allow a Dungeon Master (also known as the DM) to easily run the game without needing other rules materials or rules knowledge.

The suggested number of participants for this experience is one DM and four players, but instructions describe how to run a game for fewer players. If you have more than four players, any of the ready-to-play characters can be used by more than one player.

## The Basics

Dungeons & Dragons is a collaborative storytelling and roleplaying game. Each player takes on the role of an adventuring character: a hero with skill and knowledge—and
sometimes magic—that lets them overcome challenges and achieve greatness!

One of the participants in the game takes the role of the Dungeon Master (DM). The DM acts as the lead storyteller, the keeper of secrets, and the referee. This document provides everything you need to know to get started as a DM.

## The Adventure

Characters in Dungeons & Dragons undertake quests throughout their lives, heroic journeys and death-defying acts of courage that become tales of legend—or tales of doom!

Peril in Pinebrook contains helpful hints, suggestions, and rules explanations that assist new Dungeon Masters in running the adventure. If you’re the DM, you can run this adventure as it’s written, or you can add your own bits of story. Your imagination, and the imaginations of the other players, make each game of D&D unique.

The "Running an Adventure" section has information that can help you decide whether you want to be a DM. If you prefer to play a character instead, don’t read “Adventure Introduction” or any of the adventure beyond that. If you do, some of the fun of playing might be spoiled for you.

## The Rules

Dungeons & Dragons is a special type of game known as a roleplaying game (RPG). In D&D, the rules help determine if the characters succeed or fail at the challenges they face. They also help the entire group of players tell a fun, exciting, and memorable story.

The rules are explained in the "Using the Rules" section. The "Running an Adventure" section provides the DM advice on leading the other players through a game session. The adventure text also explains rules and game play along the way.

## The Tools

To play this game, you need this packet and some dice: at least one 20-sided die (d20) and one 6-sided die (d6). It speeds up game play if each player has their own dice, but players can share! If you don't have these dice, you can find digital dice rollers online.

Each player should also have a way to make notes and keep track of changes to their character sheet as play progresses. A pencil and paper work well.

### Character Sheets

This packet includes four character sheets and a handy guide that explains some of the rules and character options in more detail. Give each player one character sheet. If you have more than four players, they can change the names and descriptions on a duplicate character sheet so that they’ll have unique characters with similar abilities and equipment.

The “Helping the Characters” section later in this document provides more information about using character sheets.

## The Experience

Peril in Pinebrook provides a play experience that can be completed in 60 to 90 minutes. It’s fine to take breaks or run the adventure in shorter sessions.

The play experience can also be made longer if desired. Allowing time for people to roleplay their characters and talk with each other adds to the fun of D&D.

Before play begins, the DM should read through this document to get a better understanding of the rules and the adventure.

## Using the Rules

Peril in Pinebrook uses a simplified version of the Dungeons & Dragons rules to teach the game to new DMs and players. The text of the adventure also contains tips that DMs and players might find useful.

### Character Actions

A character's actions hold the potential for either success or failure. Can you hit a monster with your weapon? Can you balance on a narrow ledge as you ascend a mountain? Can you convince a dragon not to eat you?

You find the answer to these questions during the game by making a d20 roll!

### d20 Rolls

The 20-sided die (d20) is the most-used die in D&D. It is rolled whenever a character or a creature tries to do something important.

Things a character might try to do are listed under “Attacks” and “Skills” on the character sheets. Next to attacks and skills are number expressions, such as “+5 to hit.” This is the number you add to your die roll when your character uses that attack or skill.

For example, the character sheet for Shalefire Stoutheart lists “Handaxe” under “Attacks,” with “+6 to hit” next to it. If Shalefire wants to attack a monster with their handaxe, the player rolls a d20. If the die roll is a 10, the player adds 6 to the die roll for a final attack score of 16.

How does the player know if their roll succeeds or fails? Read on to find out!

### Armor Class

The number a character tries to equal or exceed with an attack roll is called Armor Class (also called AC). The higher a creature’s Armor Class, the harder that creature is to hit. In the previous example, Shalefire’s attack roll with a handaxe would hit a creature with an Armor Class of 16 or lower.

### Damage

When an attack roll hits, it deals damage. The damage roll appears after the attack on the character sheet. Shalefire’s handaxe does “1d6 + 4 damage,” so the player would roll one 6-sided die (d6) and add 4 to the die roll.

### Difficulty Class

Difficulty Class (DC) is the number that a character must equal or exceed to succeed at an action that is not an attack. This includes rolls to use skills.

For example, if Shalefire wants to move a heavy boulder blocking the mouth of a cave, that requires a skill called Athletics. Under “Skills” on Shalefire’s character sheet, it says “Athletics +6,” so Shalefire’s player rolls a 20-sided die and adds 6 to the number on the die. If the Difficulty Class to move the boulder is 12, the player would need to roll a 6 or higher for Shalefire to move the boulder.

The Difficulty Class for actions a character can attempt is given in the adventure text. In general, a Difficulty Class of 10 (DC 10) is easy, while a DC of 15 is challenging. Most of the actions in this adventure are DC 10. The Dungeon Master can change DCs if circumstances make an action easier or harder. They can also make up their own DCs when the characters attempt actions not covered in the adventure.

### Advantage and Disadvantage

Sometimes what’s happening in the adventure makes things easier for a character. At other times, the odds are stacked against the heroes. These circumstances can be reflected in D&D as “advantage” or “disadvantage.”

> **DM Tip**
> Advantage and disadvantage are powerful game tools. They make d20 rolls more likely to succeed or fail, so use them wisely. They are best used as a reward for clever play by the players, or to represent good or bad luck affecting the story. In the full version of the D&D rules, certain rules automatically give a character advantage or dis advantage. For this adventure, the DM can decide when to apply advantage or disadvantage to rolls. If a character has both advantage and disadvantage on a roll, they cancel each other out, and the roll is made normally.

#### Advantage

If Shalefire attacks a monster with a handaxe while the monster is distracted by another character, the monster can’t see the attack coming. The DM might decide the monster is easier to hit while distracted, so Shalefire would make the attack roll with advantage.

Advantage means that instead of rolling the d20 once for the attack roll, Shalefire’s player rolls the d20 twice and uses the higher roll. They then add the normal modifier (+6 for Shalefire’s handaxe) to get a final attack result.

#### Disadvantage

Disadvantage works like advantage in reverse. If something in the game makes it harder to take an action, the roll for that action is made with disadvantage. For example, as Shalefire climbs a cliff using a rope, a monster at the top of the cliff shakes the rope. Because it’s now harder to climb, Shalefire makes the d20 roll to climb the rope with disadvantage.

Disadvantage means that instead of rolling the d20 once to make the Athletics check to climb, Shalefire’s player rolls the d20 twice and uses the lower roll. They then add the normal modifier (+6 for Shalefire’s Athletics skill) to get a final result.

### Hit Points

Every creature in D&D has a number of “hit points.” This number reflects the damage a creature can take before it falls unconscious or is defeated. When a character or creature is damaged by an attack roll or a hazard in the game, the amount of damage dealt is subtracted from the character’s or creature’s hit points.

If a creature reaches 0 hit points, they are defeated. The players can decide if this means a creature is dead or unconscious or if they run away.

When a character reaches 0 hit points, they are unconscious. In this adventure, a character at 0 hit points remains unconscious until they regain hit points through healing or until the end of the encounter, when they regain 1 hit point automatically. The adventure details ways to regain hit points.

## Running an Adventure

A DM gets to use their imagination while presenting the adventure to the other players. The DM can add excitement to the game as they describe the situations and help players navigate their way through the action.

### Presenting Encounters

This adventure is divided into “encounters,” which are like scenes from a movie or show. Each encounter has specific challenges. Once the players complete the challenges, move on to the next scene. The flow of the game is described below.

### Game Flow

A D&D session begins with the DM and the other players having a conversation. The DM explains the situation the characters are in. The players can ask questions about the situation, and the DM answers those questions to further explain what’s happening.

Then the DM asks the most important question in the DM’s toolbox:

_"What do you do?"_

At this point, players should explain what they want their characters to do. (If what they want to do is impossible, the DM says so and asks the player to choose a different action. For example, a character can't walk through a wall unless they have some special ability or magic that allows them to do so.)

If the action is possible and very easy to do, the character automatically succeeds. Opening an unlocked door or lifting a light object doesn’t require heroic effort, so no d20 roll is necessary.

When the action is somewhere between easy and impossible, trying to do it could lead to success or failure. That’s when the DM calls for a d20 roll. See the "d20 Rolls" section earlier in this document.

The d20 roll, plus its modifiers, determines whether the action succeeds or fails. What does success or failure mean for an adventure? This is where you and the players get to tell a story together!

### Narrating Successes and Failures

When a d20 roll succeeds or fails, the DM and the players can turn that result into a part of the ongoing story. What does it look like when a monster is defeated? What does Shalefire say or do if the heavy boulder blocking the cave doesn’t budge? These points in the game can spark great storytelling and acting moments.

Remember, though, that part of the DM’s job is to keep the game’s story moving forward. If describing every single attack roll in a long combat gets boring, just say how much damage the attack deals and get to the next exciting moment.

### Tips for Dungeon Masters

Here are some tips for DMs that can help them run great games:

**Rule 0.** Rule 0 of D&D is simple: Have fun. It’s fine if everyone agrees to change the rules as long as doing so means the game is more fun for everyone.

**Be Supportive.** The players and the DM are all on the same team. DMs aren’t playing against the characters. The DM wins when the players have fun and the story is exciting and memorable.

**Use “Yes, and …” or “No, but …”** Allow the players to succeed as much as possible, and let them participate in the telling of the story. If they want to try something unexpected, try to say “yes” and then work their ideas into the story. If you have to say “no” to a player’s idea, suggest options that let them do something similar.

**Use Your Imagination.** Peril in Pinebrook is an outline for your game. Change or make up anything you need to if it makes the game more fun. The text can’t cover everything players might want to do. What does a monster smell like? That’s up to you, or you can ask the players what they think!

**NPCs Are Your Voice.** While the players determine what their characters do, the DM controls all the other characters in the game. Nonplayer characters (also known as NPCs) are a great tool for the DM to help the characters understand the game and the story, and to work information into the story smoothly.

**Allow Alternatives.** D&D is a game of fantasy, where heroes use wits, skill, and determination to overcome obstacles. Sometimes those obstacles are defeated with weapons and spells. But characters can succeed in other ways. Communicating with monsters, tricking them or frightening them away, or avoiding a fight while cleverly sneaking past a challenge can be just as much fun. Such options are ideal if anyone playing the game wants to avoid violence.

**Listen to Your Players.** Encourage your players to speak to you, publicly or privately, if something in the game upsets them. Then respond appropriately. For instance, you can move past upsetting topics by quickly narrating a resolution to a scene, then quickly move to the next part of the story.

## Adventure Introduction

If you are a player, stop reading here! The rest of this document is for the Dungeon Master only.

In Peril in Pinebrook, the characters find a newborn dragon and must return the infant to its mother’s lair. The lair, however, is under attack by hostile forces. As the DM, you'll present the challenges the characters face as they take the baby dragon home.

> Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud to the players. You can read boxed text word-for-word, or use your own words.

To begin the adventure, show your players the character sheets. Then read the following passage aloud to your players:

> We’re going to play a short game of Dungeons & Dragons. These character sheets have information about your characters on them. You can each have one character to play.

You can let the players choose their characters, but if you're time is limited, consider choosing characters for them.

Once each player has a character sheet, read the following:

> Write your name in the space where it says “Player Name.”
>
> Your character already has a name, which you can use if you want, or you can change the name. There's space below the name where you can give your character a nickname and add your character's pronouns.
>
> Each character sheet has a “Description” area for your character’s appearance, personality, and attitude. Choose from the options there or make up your own. You can act out how your character behaves based on their description and personality.

Offer to help the players fill out these parts of their character sheets if needed. Do your best to answer questions from players, but some questions are best answered as they come up during play. Let the players know that you'll give them more information along the way. Still, you may need to pause between each section to answer questions as you present the following information:

> Let’s go over other parts of the character sheet. There is some information you should know before we start playing.
>
> **Race and Class**. Each character in D&D has a race and a class that help determine what things a character does best. Some of the other information on a character sheet is based on a character’s race and class.
>
> **Armor Class and Hit Points**. Each character has an Armor Class (also called AC) and hit points. Armor Class tells how hard it is to hit a character with an attack roll. The higher the AC, the harder it is to hit a character. Hit points determine how much damage a character can take. When a character takes damage, subtract that damage from the character’s hit points. If a character’s hit points reach 0, they are unconscious. You'll learn how to regain hit points later in the game.
>
> **Attacks**. Each character can make attacks with melee or ranged weapons, or with melee or ranged spells. “Melee” means an attack that is used when a character is right next to a monster. “Ranged” means an attack that is used when a character isn't near a monster. The number after the attack on a character sheet is added to a d20 roll (a roll of a 20-sided die) when a character attacks. The higher the number, the more likely the attack succeeds.
>
> **Skills**. Each character can use the skills listed on their character sheet. The number after a skill shows what the player adds to a d20 roll. The higher the number, the better the character is at that skill. If a character wants to use a skill that isn't on their character sheet, the player rolls a 20-sided die but doesn’t add a number to the roll.
>
> **Equipment**. A character has equipment they can use to overcome challenges during adventures. They also might find more equipment during adventures.
>
> **Special Ability**. Each character has a special ability. This ability lets a character do something during the adventure that other characters can’t do. You get to choose when your character uses their special ability, but a character can use a special ability only a limited number of times or under special circumstances.

Explain how d20 rolls work with the following example:

> The character Noorah Eldenfield has a shortbow attack that says “+5 to hit.” When Noorah attacks with a shortbow, Noorah's player rolls a d20 and adds 5 to the number rolled on the die. I’ll tell you if that attack hits the monster. If it does, Noorah’s shortbow attack also says “Damage 1d6 + 3.” The player rolls a 6-sided die and adds 3 to determine the damage dealt by the attack.

A “Player Reference Sheet” also details some of the terms on the character sheets.

Now let’s get on with the game!
