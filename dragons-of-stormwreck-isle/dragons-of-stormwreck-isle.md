# DRAGONS OF STORMWRECK ISLE

# Running the Adventure

This is for the Dungeon Master. It contains a complete Dungeons & Dragons adventure, as well as descriptions for the magic items and creatures in the adventure. It also teaches you how to run a D&D game.

## Overview

A D&D adventure is a collection of locations, quests, and challenges that inspire you to tell a story. The outcome of that story is determined by the actions and decisions of the adventurers—and the luck of the dice.

Dragons of Stormwreck Isle draws the characters into the midst of an ancient war among dragons as they explore an island that has long been a battlefield in that conflict. Here’s an overview of what you’ll find:

**Running the Adventure.** The adventure starts with an overview. Then it takes a look at the role of the Dungeon Master in a game of D&D, and some tips to help you in this role.

**Adventure Sites.** The four chapters of the adventure describe locations on Stormwreck Isle where characters can explore, interact with various creatures, and pursue their goals. The first site, Dragon’s Rest, serves as the characters’ home base during the adventure, where they can rest and get supplies between their visits to the other sites.

**Magic Items and Monsters.** Two appendixes describe rules for magic items and monsters that characters might find in the course of the adventure.

## Getting Started

Before you get started, get familiar with the contents of this adventure. If you think there are elements your players might find scary or might make them uncomfortable, check in with the players before you start playing. Without giving away the story that awaits them, talk about the potentially troubling aspects and discuss how you’d like to handle them. This check-in is an important part of making sure everyone has a safe and fun time playing the game.

### Premade Characters

To get started, have each player choose one character to play.

#### Dwarf Cleric

You trained as a soldier on the island of Mintarn and joined a mercenary company. You traveled to the city of Neverwinter with your company to serve in both the army and city watch. Over time, you grew disillusioned with many of your fellow soldiers. They seemed to enjoy their authority at the expense of the people they’re supposed to protect.

Recently you’ve had dreams of a shadow creeping across the sea like a shroud, swallowing an island in darkness. Though you dismissed the dreams at first, you began to hear a voice calling you to stand against death’s endless hunger. Certain of your deity’s wishes, you resigned your post and set out on your quest.

Personal Goal: Banish a Shadow of Death. Researching images from your dreams pointed you to Stormwreck Isle, not far from Neverwinter. A remote cloister there holds a temple to the dragon god Bahamut, who is a patron of heroes and a champion of justice. Someone at the cloister may hold the key to the impending doom your deity wishes you to avert.

#### Elf Fighter

Your parents lived in the prosperous village of Thundertree, east of the city of Neverwinter and at the edge of the Neverwinter Wood. But when nearby Mount Hotenow erupted thirty years ago, your parents fled, perhaps carrying you in your infancy (depending on how old you are). Your family drifted from village to village around the region, finding work as laborers where they could.

You’ve spent the last few years in Neverwinter as a carpenter working at the city’s bustling docks. But it’s clear to you and everyone around you that you are destined for much more. You stood up to an abusive ship captain once, so other dockworkers look up to you. Someday, you’ll come into your own. You’ll be a hero.

**Personal Goal: Determine Your Destiny.** In the remote cloister of Dragon’s Rest lives an old sage who is supposed to possess great wisdom—or possibly supernatural insight. The cloister holds a temple to the dragon god Bahamut, who is a patron of heroes and a champion of justice. Maybe Elder Runara can help you determine exactly what your heroic destiny is and set you on the right path to fulfill it, so you can become the hero you know you’re meant to be.

#### Elf Wizard

Your parents identified your magical talent early in your long elven life and arranged for you to be apprenticed to a kindly wizard in the city of Neverwinter. You excelled at your studies and forged friendships and rivalries with other apprentices. You always had a particular knack for wielding flashy, energetic forces, and you focused your study on the school of evocation.

After graduating from your apprenticeship, you and your peers went your separate ways to focus on your own studies. Recently, you received a letter from one of your colleagues, pointing you toward a source of lost knowledge. Shortly after the letter arrived, you learned tragic news: your friend died under mysterious circumstances.

**Personal Goal: Discover Lost Knowledge.** The letter spoke of an arcane observatory built on a nearby island by wizards long gone, and it hinted at powerful magic hidden there. A small cloister known as Dragon’s Rest also resides on the island. The caretaker of the cloister’s temple to the dragon god Bahamut, who is a patron of heroes and a champion of justice, must have information regarding the observatory. This Elder Runara can set you on the path to discovering the knowledge your friend never found.

#### Halfling Rogue

You fell in with a thieves’ guild called the Gilded Gallows at an early age. The guild has prospered in recent years, and its influence is spreading across the Sword Coast. You followed that expansion, hoping to find your fortune in the city of Neverwinter.

Fortunes in Neverwinter have been fair but not the fast riches you hoped for. You heard a story from a smuggler about a high-ranking member of the Gilded Gallows who turned traitor, killed their partner, and fled with a sovereign’s ransom in treasure. Thanks to details you’ve picked up here and there that corroborate the story, you’re certain it’s more than just a rumor.

**Personal Goal: Find the Lost Fortune.** Whoever that Gilder was who skipped out with the gold, they’ve covered their tracks well. The trail went cold in Neverwinter, but recently you’ve learned of a remote island cloister called Dragon’s Rest. The cloister holds a temple to the dragon god Bahamut, who is a patron of heroes and a champion of justice. There is also a community of hermits who live there now, the perfect place to hide for someone wishing to escape their past. If that treasure’s there, you’ll find it.

#### Human Paladin

Your family is no stranger to wealth, power, and privilege. In the glory days of Neverwinter, your parents ruled the county of Corlinn Hill, located in the hills northeast of the city. But Mount Hotenow erupted thirty years ago, devastating Neverwinter and erasing Corlinn Hill. Instead of growing up on an estate, you were raised in a small townhouse in Waterdeep. As an adult, you stand to inherit only a title.

Since swearing your oath to Bahamut, you’ve returned to Neverwinter and have been a champion to those who are overlooked by the institutions that exist to protect them. Recently, your resolve has been shaken by corruption in the city guard and ruling aristocrats.

**Personal Goal: Rejuvenating Pilgrimage.** Seeking to reinvigorate your resolve, you learned of a remote cloister, Dragon’s Rest, on a tiny island. The cloister holds a temple to the dragon god Bahamut. You feel drawn to contemplate your place in the world there.

Tell the players to read over the character sheets; give their characters names; and invent the details of their characters’ personality and appearance. Encourage the players to write on the character sheets to make these characters their own.

## The Forgotten Realms

The Forgotten Realms is a world of high fantasy, populated by elves, dwarves, halflings, humans, and other folk—one of many such worlds in the vast multiverse of the D&D game. In the Realms, fighters dare the crypts of the fallen dwarf kings of Delzoun, seeking glory and treasure. Rogues prowl the dark alleyways of teeming cities such as Neverwinter and Baldur’s Gate. Clerics in the service of gods wield mace and spell, defending against the terrifying powers that threaten the land. Wizards plunder the ruins of the fallen Netherese empire, delving into secrets too sinister for the light of day.

The roads and rivers of the Realms carry minstrels and peddlers, merchants and guards, soldiers and sailors. Bold adventurers follow tales of strange, glorious, faraway places. Good maps and clear trails can take even an inexperienced youth with dreams of glory far across the world, but these paths are never safe. Travelers in the Realms face fell magic and deadly monsters. Even farms and freeholds a day’s walk from a city can fall prey to monsters, and no place is safe from the wrath of a dragon.

This adventure takes place on Stormwreck Isle, a small island in a region called the Sword Coast. This region is a place of adventure, where daring souls delve into ancient strongholds and explore the ruins of long-lost kingdoms. Amid a lawless wilderness of jagged, snow-capped peaks, alpine forests, bitter winds, and roaming monsters, the coast holds renowned bastions of civilization such as the city of Neverwinter, in the shadow of the fuming volcano known as Mount Hotenow.

> NUMBER OF PLAYERS
>
> You can run Dragons of Stormwreck Isle for one to five players. If you have four or five friends ready to play with you, each person can take one of the characters provided above. Five players will find the encounters a little easier than four players will, but the adventure works fine as written for groups of four or five players.
>
> If you have fewer than four players, you can have some players take on the role of two characters so the group has at least four characters. A player with two characters should treat one of them as their main character and the other as a sidekick, there to help out but probably not engaging in a lot of dialogue.

## Adventure Background

According to legend, two families of dragons came into being in the very first days of the world’s creation. Bahamut, the noble Platinum Dragon, made the metallic dragons—gold, silver, bronze, brass, and copper. Cruel, five-headed Tiamat made the chromatic dragons—red, blue, green, black and white. The metallic and chromatic dragons share a mutual animosity that originates in the enmity between Bahamut and Tiamat (Bahamut is often called the King of Metallic Dragons in the world of the Forgotten Realms, and Tiamat the Queen of Chromatic Dragons. In other worlds they have different names, and like all gods, they are beyond gender.)

The origin of Dragon’s Rest is rooted in that animosity. Ages ago, a fire-breathing red dragon called Sharruth rampaged up and down the Sword Coast. Three metallic dragons joined forces to battle Sharruth and imprisoned her beneath the ocean floor, believing seawater would quench her fire and keep her bound forever. But Sharruth’s fury, legend says, caused the undersea volcanic activity that formed Stormwreck Isle.

In all likelihood, Sharruth is long dead and entombed beneath the island, but chromatic dragons whisper that she still lives and will one day emerge from her prison. One fact is undeniable: the powerful magic embodied in such an ancient dragon has left a permanent mark on Stormwreck Isle. That magic has drawn other dragons to the island throughout the centuries, making it a recurring battlefield in the conflict between chromatic and metallic dragons. Several of these dragons have died there, each leaving behind a spiritual scar that causes unpredictable magical effects.

A hundred years ago, a blue dragon tried to harness this destructive magic. A bronze dragon named [Runara](#) pleaded with him to abandon his schemes. When he refused, Runara killed him, adding one more dragon grave to the island.

Runara has grown weary of strife, and Stormwreck Isle’s wounds are a constant reminder to her of the cost of such conflict. Devoting herself to peace and reconciliation, she established the cloister of Dragon’s Rest as a safe haven from violence. Living in human guise, Runara now serves as the leader of a tiny group of hermits and ascetics.

But the ageless conflict between chromatic and metallic dragons threatens to disrupt the serenity of Dragon’s Rest—and this is where the adventure begins!

### Adventure Outline

In _Dragons of Stormwreck Isle_, the characters experience the magical scars left behind by the death of dragons. Faced with the evil schemes of one living dragon and the righteous anger of another, they’ll have the chance to explore whether peace between the feuding dragon families is possible—or if they must resort to violence to resolve the conflict on this isle.

This adventure has four chapters:

[Chapter 1](#), “Dragon’s Rest,” introduces Runara’s cloister and its inhabitants and provides the characters the opportunity to learn about the problems facing the island. It also describes additional encounters you can use in the course of the adventure, including a magical hot spring with mysterious guardians at the site of a brass dragon’s death.

[Chapter 2](#), “Seagrow Caves,” describes how the grave of Sharruth spawns magical connections to the Elemental Plane of Fire that threaten a community of mushroom-like myconids.

[Chapter 3](#), “Cursed Shipwreck,” details a ship that crashed alongside the bones of a gold dragon and the horrible curse within the ship’s hold.

[Chapter 4](#), “Clifftop Observatory,” brings the characters to the site where Runara killed a blue dragon—and where that blue dragon’s grandson has made his lair. There they’ll also find a bronze wyrmling who rejected Runara’s teachings of peace, now held prisoner in the blue dragon’s lair.

### Adventure Maps

The maps in this adventure are for the DM’s eyes only. These maps show secret doors and other elements the players aren’t meant to see.

[map of Stormwreck Isle]

When the characters arrive at a location marked on a map, describe it to give them a clear mental picture of the location. You can also draw what they see on paper, copying what’s on your map while omitting secret details. It’s not important that your hand-drawn map perfectly match what’s in the adventure. Try to get the basic shape and dimensions correct and leave the rest to the players’ imaginations.

## The Dungeon Master

The Dungeon Master has a special role in D&D games.

The DM is a **storyteller**. The DM presents the challenges and encounters that the characters must overcome. The DM is the players’ interface to the D&D world, who reads (and sometimes also writes) the adventure and describes what happens in response to the characters’ actions.

The DM is a **referee**. When it’s not clear what ought to happen next, the DM decides how to apply the rules and keep the story going.

The DM is a **roleplayer**. The DM plays the monsters in the adventure, choosing their actions and rolling dice for their attacks. The DM also plays all the other people the characters meet, including helpful ones.

### DM Tips

The most important part of being a good DM is facilitating the fun of everyone at the table. Keep these tips in mind to help things go smoothly:

**Embrace the shared story.** D&D is about telling a story as a group, so let the players contribute to the outcome through the words and deeds of their characters. If some players are reluctant to speak up, ask them what their characters are doing.

**It’s not a competition.** The DM isn’t competing against the player characters. Your job is to referee the rules, run monsters, and keep the story moving.

**Be fair and flexible.** Treat your players in a fair, impartial manner. The rules help you do this, but you can make your own rulings to ensure everyone is having fun.

**Modify the adventure to suit your tastes.** The adventure has no prescribed outcome. You can alter any encounter to make it more interesting and fun for your players.

**Keep a notepad handy.** Use it to track details such as the characters’ and monsters’ initiative order.

#### Sharing Information

As Dungeon Master, one of your most important tasks is figuring out how much to tell the players and when. All the information the players need to make choices comes from you. Within the rules of the game and the limits of the characters’ knowledge and senses, tell players everything they need to know.

> Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased to the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text. It usually describes locations or presents scripted dialogue, so the players know what’s up and have a sense of what their characters’ options are.

You don’t have to reveal every aspect of a situation or hazard in one go. Boxed text typically describes everything the characters see, hear, or smell at first glance. As characters search rooms, make Wisdom ([Perception](#)) or Intelligence ([Investigation](#)) checks, open drawers and chests, and generally examine things more closely, give players more details about what their characters find.

**Creature Stat Blocks.** Whenever the adventure text presents a creature’s name in **bold** type, that’s a visual cue directing you to the creature’s stat block in [appendix B.](#) Those stat blocks are intended for your eyes only. However, as the characters fight monsters, you can reveal certain information to help them make smart choices in combat:

**Hit Points.** You can give players a sense of how well they’re doing against a creature by describing, in narrative terms, how hurt the creature is. For example, if the creature has fewer than half its hit points remaining, you can describe it as being badly wounded. Such information gives the players a sense of progress and might spur them to press the attack. On the other hand, if the characters aren’t damaging the creature much, let the players know that the creature looks like it can take a lot more punishment. That might encourage the players to change their plan.

**Abilities, Strengths, and Weaknesses.** As they fight a creature, characters should learn more about the creature’s abilities. Share information with the players as it becomes apparent. For example, if the wizard casts [flaming sphere](#) (a spell that deals fire damage) against a [fire snake](#) (a creature that’s immune to fire damage), let the wizard’s player know the spell doesn’t seem to bother the creature at all. Players might correctly guess that a fire snake probably isn’t harmed by fire; feel free to subtly confirm their guesses (perhaps smiling and saying, “That sounds reasonable”).

**Story Information.** A location description might include important information not in boxed text. Often you’re meant to reveal such information when the characters examine particular areas or interact with creatures.

As the DM, you roleplay the creatures that the characters encounter. The adventure offers guidance to help you decide what these creatures know and how willing they are to share information with the characters. Beyond that, improvise and bring these creatures to life as best you can. For example, the adventure describes [Runara](#) (the disguised bronze dragon who leads the cloister of Dragon’s Rest) as wise and peace-loving, but you get to decide what her voice sounds like and how she reacts to a given situation. You can also ignore what the text says and roleplay Runara or any other creature as you see fit.

**_Treasure._** When characters find treasure, tell them how many coins they find and how much any gems and art objects are worth. Sometimes treasure includes magic items, whose names are presented in italic type. [Appendix A](#) describes these items and their properties, as well as the rules for how characters figure out what a magic item does.

#### Making Mistakes

Dungeon Masters are fallible, just like everyone else, and even experienced DMs make mistakes. If you overlook, forget, or misrepresent something, correct yourself and move on. No one expects you to memorize every part of this adventure and all the rules in the Basic Rules. As long as your players are having fun, everything will be just fine.

#### Improvising Ability Checks

The adventure often tells you what ability checks characters might try in certain situations and the Difficulty Class (DC) of those checks. But sometimes characters try things that the adventure can’t anticipate. In that case, you decide how to handle it.

Ability checks are for situations where a character’s success or failure isn’t guaranteed. If anyone can easily accomplish a task, don’t ask for an ability check. Just tell the player what happens. And if there’s no way anyone could accomplish the task, just tell the player it doesn’t work.

When you decide an ability check is required, consult the “[Ability Checks](#)” section of the [Basic Rules](#) and the table of [Typical Difficulty Classes](#). Most of the time, choose a DC that is easy (DC 10), moderate (DC 15), or hard (DC 20).

# Chapter 1: Dragon's Rest

The adventure begins at a tiny cloister called Dragon’s Rest, a haven where world-weary people come to seek peace, reconciliation, and enlightenment. There, the characters learn about the dangers facing Stormwreck Isle.

Each character has a specific reason for coming to the cloister, as shown on [the character sheets](#). You can also let players invent their own reasons for their characters to seek out Runara’s wisdom and assistance.

## Welcome to Dragon's Rest

Read the following text when you’re ready to start:

> Your journey was uneventful, but the island now visible off the bow promises rare wonders. Seaweed shimmers in countless brilliant colors below you, and rays of sunlight defy the overcast sky to illuminate the lush grass and dark basalt rock of the island. Avoiding the rocks jutting up from the ocean, your ship makes its way toward a calm harbor on the island’s north side.
>
> A large, open-air temple comes into view, perched on the edge of a cliff high above you. The ship drops anchor at the mouth of the harbor, and two sailors row you ashore. You have plenty of time to admire the towering statue at the center of the temple, depicting a wizened man surrounded by seven songbirds. A long path winds up the side of the cliff to the temple, dotted along the way with doorways cut into the rock.
>
> The sailors set you ashore on a rickety dock, where a large rowboat is neatly tied. They point to the base of the path and wish you good luck before they row back to the ship. Your visit to Dragon’s Rest begins!

Before continuing with the adventure, encourage the players to introduce their characters to each other if they haven’t done so already. They might want to discuss their reasons for visiting Dragon’s Rest, or they might prefer to keep their reasons secret for now. If they have any questions about what they can see of the cloister from the boat, use [map 2](#) and the information in “[Dragon’s Rest Locations](#)” to answer them.

Ask the players to give you the party’s marching order as they start toward the cloister. Who’s in front, and who’s bringing up the rear? Make a note of this marching order.

When you’re ready, continue with the “Drowned Sailors” section.

### Drowned Sailors

Read the following text to start the encounter:

> As you’re about to leave the beach and start your climb, you hear a ruckus of splashing and a wet, gurgling moan behind you. Three figures are shambling up from the water’s edge, about thirty feet away. They’re dressed as sailors, but their skin is gray and they look drowned. Sea water drools from their slack mouths as they lurch toward you.

The three shambling sailors are [zombies](#), the animated corpses of sailors who died in a recent shipwreck. The characters face a choice: they can turn and fight the zombies, or they can continue up the path and leave the slow, shambling zombies behind.

If the characters turn and fight, this is the first combat encounter in the adventure. Here are the steps you should follow to run it:

1. Review the [zombie](#) stat block in [appendix B](#).
2. Use the initiative rules to determine who acts first, second, third, and so on. Keep track of everyone’s initiative count on your notepad.
3. On the zombies’ initiative count, they move toward the characters. If they get close enough, they make melee attacks. The zombies’ stat block contains the information you need to resolve these attacks. If all the characters are more than 20 feet away, the zombies use the [Dash](#) action so they can move farther. For more information on what the zombies can do on their turn, see “[Combat](#)” in the [Basic Rules](#).
4. The zombies fight until they’re all defeated.

**_Tip: Undead Fortitude_**. The zombies’ Undead Fortitude trait reflects how hard it is to kill these walking corpses. When this trait prevents a zombie from dying, give the players a hint about what happened. You might say, “That should have finished the creature off, but it refuses to stop moving!” On the flip side, any time a zombie takes radiant damage (such as from the cleric’s [sacred flame](#) cantrip), you might describe the creature howling in agony. This can help the players realize that radiant damage is a way to get around Undead Fortitude. If the players ask whether their characters know anything about fighting zombies, have them make DC 10 Intelligence checks. Those who succeed might recall that a particularly powerful blow (a [critical hit](#)) or radiant damage can help finish off a zombie.

**_Runara’s Aid_**. In the unlikely event that the zombies defeat the adventurers, [Runara](#) comes to their rescue. The characters wake up in the temple ([area A5](#) in Dragon’s Rest). Runara explains that she heard the sounds of combat and arrived just in time to prevent the zombies from dragging the characters into the sea.

**_Avoiding the Zombies_**. If the characters decide not to fight the zombies, they easily escape from the slow, shambling monsters. The zombies don’t follow them up the path toward Dragon’s Rest. The characters will have another opportunity to deal with the zombies later (see “[Cloister Quests](#)” later in this chapter).

## Meeting the Inhabitants
Read this text when the characters first climb the path to Dragon’s Rest:

>Your arrival quickly draws the attention of the entire population of the place—which consists mostly of kobolds. These small, reptilian folk eye you curiously while a couple of humans watch from a distance. All the cloister’s residents are dressed in simple clothes, and no one carries a visible weapon. One of the kobolds pipes up with, “What’s your name?”
>
>At that, all the kobolds begin barraging you with questions—“Where are you from?” “What’s that?” “Why are you here?” and more that are lost in the din.

Visitors to the cloister are rare, and the kobolds’ curiosity is insatiable; they keep asking questions until the characters insist they stop.

When the characters quiet the kobolds (or if the players start showing signs of exasperation), the leader of the cloister approaches to welcome the characters. Read the following text:

>The chattering kobolds fall silent as a new figure comes into view, descending gracefully from the upper part of the cloister. She’s an elderly human woman with weathered brown skin, white hair in tight braids, and kindly hazel eyes, dressed in a simple white robe. She smiles as she draws near and extends her arms in greeting.
>
>“Welcome to Dragon’s Rest,” she says. “May Bahamut’s guidance lead you to whatever you seek.”

This is Elder [Runara](#), the leader of Dragon’s Rest. If the characters defeated the zombies at the beach, she thanks them for their service to the cloister. Even if they did not fight the zombies, she tells them they’re welcome to stay at Dragon’s Rest as long as they wish, sleeping either in one of the monastic cells ([area A1](#)) or in the temple ([area A5](#)) and eating with the rest of the community in the dining room ([area A3](#)). Runara says nothing about payment of any kind. If the characters offer to give money or perform services around the cloister in exchange for her hospitality, she accepts these gifts.

Throughout this adventure, Dragon’s Rest serves as a home base for the characters. All the places they’ll explore on the island are within a few miles of the cloister, and they can return here whenever they wish to rest, heal, and get information they need for the next part of their adventures. In addition, they can buy any of the [equipment](#) described in the [Basic Rules](#) from Myla (see “[Kobolds](#)”).

During their time at Dragon’s Rest, the characters can interact with any of its residents. All the residents but Runara live in the small monastic cells cut into the cliff face (area A1 on the cloister map).

### Elder Runara
Elder [Runara](#) is the leader of Dragon’s Rest. She appears as a human woman, but she is actually an adult bronze dragon disguised in human form. She guides the residents of the cloister in their contemplation and study. The cloister’s inhabitants know Runara’s true identity, but they do not speak of it to visitors.

Runara’s initial attitude toward the characters is indifferent (see “[Social Interaction](#)” in the [Basic Rules](#)). She becomes friendly as soon as the characters demonstrate that they care about the cloister’s safety, such as by fighting the zombies at the beach or undertaking any of the quests she offers them (see “[Cloister Quests](#)” later in this chapter). If the characters harm any of the residents of Dragon’s Rest, she becomes hostile and insists the characters make amends for the harm they did before she is willing to deal with them in any way.

Runara’s mission is to help those whose lives have been shaped by violence find new paths forward in peace. Ultimately, she would like to see chromatic and metallic dragons find a peaceful way to coexist in the world. In the meantime, she finds comfort in helping humans and other people escape from cycles of violence.

Runara maintains a secret lair in a cave accessed by an undersea tunnel, a short distance from the cloister and not shown on the map of Dragon’s Rest. She is careful not to enter or leave the cave when anyone might spot her, and she enters and emerges from the water in the open ocean, out of sight of the cloister. The other residents of the cloister think she lives in the temple at the top of the island ([area A5](#)), or they simply laugh away queries about her accommodations, explaining that she’s always in the temple, or in the library, or checking on the rest of the residents—she never seems to sleep!

### Kobolds
Kobolds are small reptilian Humanoids who believe they are descended from dragons and often live near them. Over the centuries, many bands of kobolds have been drawn to Stormwreck Isle by the lingering draconic magic that suffuses the island. Nine kobolds utterly devoted to Runara now live at Dragon’s Rest.

[kobolds picture]
EVER SINCE AN UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT IN THE KITCHEN,
LAYLEE IS NO LONGER ALLOWED TO HANDLE
MYLA’S ALCHEMICAL FIRE.

The [kobolds](#) of Dragon’s Rest are lawful good, sharing Runara’s ideals of justice and compassion. Since they are sensitive to sunlight, they work at night and avoid moving about during the day. Unless otherwise noted, the kobolds are initially friendly toward the adventurers.

The kobolds are summarized below. They can offer a local perspective or be a way for you to pass hints to the players if they’re having trouble putting things together. But don’t feel like you need to bring all nine of these kobolds to life! Pick one or two of these kobolds that you and the characters like the most and let them be the focus of the characters’ interactions with the kobolds:
