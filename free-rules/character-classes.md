Barbarians are mighty warriors who are powered by primal forces of the multiverse that manifest as a Rage. More than a mere emotion—and not limited to anger—this Rage is an incarnation of a predator’s ferocity, a storm’s fury, and a sea’s turmoil.

Some Barbarians personify their Rage as a fierce spirit or revered forebear. Others see it as a connection to the pain and anguish of the world, as an impersonal tangle of wild magic, or as an expression of their own deepest self. For every Barbarian, their Rage is a power that fuels not just battle prowess, but also uncanny reflexes and heightened senses.

Barbarians often serve as protectors and leaders in their communities. They charge headlong into danger so those under their protection don’t have to. Their courage in the face of danger makes Barbarians perfectly suited for adventure.

#### Level 1: Rage

You can imbue yourself with a primal power called Rage, a force that grants you extraordinary might and resilience. You can enter it as a Bonus Action if you aren’t wearing Heavy armor.

You can enter your Rage the number of times shown for your Barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian Features table. You regain one expended use when you finish a [Short Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

While active, your Rage follows the rules below.

**_Damage Resistance._** You have Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.

**_Rage Damage._** When you make an attack using Strength—with either a weapon or an [Unarmed Strike](/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike)—and deal damage to the target, you gain a bonus to the damage that increases as you gain levels as a Barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian Features table.

**_Strength Advantage._** You have Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

**_No Concentration or Spells._** You can’t maintain [Concentration](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), and you can’t cast spells.

**_Duration._** The Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, and it ends early if you don Heavy armor or have the [Incapacitated](/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition. If your Rage is still active on your next turn, you can extend the Rage for another round by doing one of the following:

- Make an attack roll against an enemy.
- Force an enemy to make a saving throw.
- Take a Bonus Action to extend your Rage.

Each time the Rage is extended, it lasts until the end of your next turn. You can maintain a Rage for up to 10 minutes.

#### Level 1: Unarmored Defense

While you aren’t wearing any armor, your base [Armor Class](/free-rules/rules-glossary#ArmorClass) equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Constitution modifiers. You can use a Shield and still gain this benefit.

#### Level 1: Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the [mastery properties](/free-rules/equipment#MasteryProperties) of two kinds of Simple or Martial Melee weapons of your choice, such as Greataxes and Handaxes. Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can practice weapon drills and change one of those weapon choices.

When you reach certain Barbarian levels, you gain the ability to use the mastery properties of more kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery column of the [Barbarian Features table](/free-rules/character-classes#BarbarianFeatures).

#### Level 2: Danger Sense

You gain an uncanny sense of when things aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge perils. You have [Advantage](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on Dexterity saving throws unless you have the [Incapacitated](/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition.

#### Level 2: Reckless Attack

You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with increased ferocity. When you make your first attack roll on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you [Advantage](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on attack rolls using Strength until the start of your next turn, but attack rolls against you have Advantage during that time.

#### Level 3: Barbarian Subclass

You gain a Barbarian subclass of your choice. The [Path of the Berserker](/free-rules/character-classes#PathoftheBerserker), [Path of the Wild Heart](/free-rules/character-classes#PathoftheWildHeart), [Path of the World Tree](/free-rules/character-classes#PathoftheWorldTree), and [Path of the Zealot](/free-rules/character-classes#PathoftheZealot) subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Barbarian levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Barbarian level or lower.

#### Level 3: Primal Knowledge

You gain proficiency in another skill of your choice from the skill list available to Barbarians at [level 1](/free-rules/character-classes#CoreBarbarianTraits).

In addition, while your Rage is active, you can channel primal power when you attempt certain tasks; whenever you make an ability check using one of the following skills, you can make it as a Strength check even if it normally uses a different ability: [Acrobatics](/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Intimidation](/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Perception](/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Stealth](/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), or [Survival](/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills). When you use this ability, your Strength represents primal power coursing through you, honing your agility, bearing, and senses.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](/free-rules/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the [Attack](/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn.

#### Level 5: Fast Movement

Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing Heavy armor.

#### Level 7: Feral Instinct

Your instincts are so honed that you have [Advantage](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on [Initiative](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Initiative) rolls.

#### Level 7: Instinctive Pounce

As part of the Bonus Action you take to enter your Rage, you can move up to half your Speed.

#### Level 9: Brutal Strike

If you use Reckless Attack, you can forgo any [Advantage](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on one Strength-based attack roll of your choice on your turn. The chosen attack roll mustn’t have [Disadvantage](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage). If the chosen attack roll hits, the target takes an extra 1d10 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon or [Unarmed Strike](/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike), and you can cause one Brutal Strike effect of your choice. You have the following effect options.

**_Forceful Blow._** The target is pushed 15 feet straight away from you. You can then move up to half your Speed straight toward the target without provoking [Opportunity Attacks](/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack).

**_Hamstring Blow._** The target’s Speed is reduced by 15 feet until the start of your next turn. A target can be affected by only one Hamstring Blow at a time—the most recent one.

#### Level 11: Relentless Rage

Your Rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 Hit Points while your Rage is active and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, your Hit Points instead change to a number equal to twice your Barbarian level.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a [Short](/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), the DC resets to 10.

#### Level 13: Improved Brutal Strike

You have honed new ways to attack furiously. The following effects are now among your Brutal Strike options.

**_Staggering Blow._** The target has [Disadvantage](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on the next saving throw it makes, and it can’t make [Opportunity Attacks](/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack) until the start of your next turn.

**_Sundering Blow._** Before the start of your next turn, the next attack roll made by another creature against the target gains a +5 bonus to the roll. An attack roll can gain only one Sundering Blow bonus.

#### Level 15: Persistent Rage

When you roll [Initiative](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Initiative), you can regain all expended uses of Rage. After you regain uses of Rage in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

In addition, your Rage is so fierce that it now lasts for 10 minutes without you needing to do anything to extend it from round to round. Your Rage ends early if you have the [Unconscious](/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition) condition (not just the [Incapacitated](/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition) or don Heavy armor.

#### Level 17: Improved Brutal Strike

The extra damage of your Brutal Strike increases to 2d10. In addition, you can use two different Brutal Strike effects whenever you use your Brutal Strike feature.

#### Level 18: Indomitable Might

If your total for a Strength check or Strength saving throw is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](/free-rules/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Irresistible Offense](/free-rules/feats#BoonofIrresistibleOffense) is recommended.

#### Level 20: Primal Champion

You embody primal power. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4, to a maximum of 25.

### Barbarian Subclasses

A Barbarian subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the Path of the Berserker subclass.

#### Path of the Berserker

_Channel Rage into Violent Fury_

Barbarians who walk the Path of the Berserker direct their Rage primarily toward violence. Their path is one of untrammeled fury, and they thrill in the chaos of battle as they allow their Rage to seize and empower them.

##### Level 3: Frenzy

If you use Reckless Attack while your Rage is active, you deal extra damage to the first target you hit on your turn with a Strength-based attack. To determine the extra damage, roll a number of d6s equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them together. The damage has the same type as the weapon or [Unarmed Strike](/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) used for the attack.

##### Level 6: Mindless Rage

You have Immunity to the [Charmed](/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) and [Frightened](/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) conditions while your Rage is active. If you’re Charmed or Frightened when you enter your Rage, the condition ends on you.

##### Level 10: Retaliation

When you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can take a Reaction to make one melee attack against that creature, using a weapon or an [Unarmed Strike](/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike).

##### Level 14: Intimidating Presence

As a Bonus Action, you can strike terror into others with your menacing presence and primal power. When you do so, each creature of your choice in a 30-foot [Emanation](/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect) originating from you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, a creature has the [Frightened](/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of the Frightened creature’s turns, the creature repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you expend a use of your Rage (no action required) to restore your use of it.

Invoking magic through music, dance, and verse, Bards are expert at inspiring others, soothing hurts, disheartening foes, and creating illusions. Bards believe the multiverse was spoken into existence and that remnants of its Words of Creation still resound and glimmer on every plane of existence. Bardic magic attempts to harness those words, which transcend any language.

Anything can inspire a new song or tale, so Bards are fascinated by almost everything. They become masters of many things, including performing music, working magic, and making jests.

A Bard’s life is spent traveling, gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer. But Bards’ depth of knowledge and mastery of magic sets them apart.

#### Level 1: Bardic Inspiration {#Level1BardicInspiration}

You can supernaturally inspire others through words, music, or dance. This inspiration is represented by your Bardic Inspiration die, which is a d6.

**_Using Bardic Inspiration._** As a Bonus Action, you can inspire another creature within 60 feet of yourself who can see or hear you. That creature gains one of your Bardic Inspiration dice. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

Once within the next hour when the creature fails a [D20 Test](/free-rules/rules-glossary#D20Test), the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning the failure into a success. A Bardic Inspiration die is expended when it’s rolled.

**_Number of Uses._** You can confer a Bardic Inspiration die a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

**_At Higher Levels._** Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain Bard levels, as shown in the Bardic Die column of the Bard Features table. The die becomes a d8 at level 5, a d10 at level 10, and a d12 at level 15.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting {#Level1BardSpellcasting}

You have learned to cast spells through your bardic arts. See [chapter 7](/free-rules/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Bard spells, which appear in the [Bard spell list](/free-rules/character-classes#BardSpellList) later in the class’s description.

**_Cantrips._** You know two cantrips of your choice from the Bard spell list. [Dancing Lights](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619058-dancing-lights) and [Vicious Mockery](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619216-vicious-mockery) are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list.

When you reach Bard levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the [Bard Features table](/free-rules/character-classes#BardFeatures).

**_Spell Slots._** The Bard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

**_Prepared Spells of Level 1+._** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Bard spell list. [Charm Person](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618964-charm-person), [Color Spray](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618978-color-spray), [Dissonant Whispers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619104-dissonant-whispers), and [Healing Word](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619143-healing-word) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the [Bard Features table](/free-rules/character-classes#BardFeatures). Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Bard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Bard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Bard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Bard spells for you.

**_Changing Your Prepared Spells._** Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Bard spell for which you have spell slots.

**_Spellcasting Ability._** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Bard spells.

**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use a **[Musical Instrument](/free-rules/equipment#MusicalInstrumentVaries)** as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells.

#### Level 2: Expertise {#Level2Expertise}

You gain [Expertise](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Expertise) (see the [rules glossary](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Expertise)) in two of your skill proficiencies of your choice. [Performance](/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) and [Persuasion](/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) are recommended if you have proficiency in them.

At Bard level 9, you gain Expertise in two more of your skill proficiencies of your choice.

#### Level 2: Jack of All Trades {#Level2JackofAllTrades}

You can add half your Proficiency Bonus (round down) to any ability check you make that uses a skill proficiency you lack and that doesn’t otherwise use your Proficiency Bonus.

For example, if you make a Strength ([Athletics](/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check and lack [Athletics](/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) proficiency, you can add half your Proficiency Bonus to the check.

A Bard’s Repertoire

Does your Bard beat a drum while chanting the deeds of ancient heroes? Strum a lute while crooning romantic tunes? Perform arias of stirring power? Recite dramatic monologues from classic tragedies? Use the rhythm of a folk dance to coordinate the movement of allies in battle? Compose naughty limericks?

When you play a Bard, consider the style of artistic performance you favor, the moods you might invoke, and the themes that inspire your own creations. Are your poems inspired by moments of natural beauty, or are they brooding reflections on loss? Do you prefer lofty hymns or rowdy tavern songs? Are you drawn to laments for the fallen or celebrations of joy? Do you dance merry jigs or perform elaborate interpretive choreography? Do you focus on one style of performance or strive to master them all?

#### Level 3: Bard Subclass {#Level3BardSubclass}

You gain a Bard subclass of your choice. The [College of Lore](/free-rules/character-classes#CollegeofLore) subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Bard levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Bard level or lower.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement {#Level4BardAbilityScoreImprovement}

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](/free-rules/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Bard levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Font of Inspiration {#Level5FontofInspiration}

You now regain all your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a [Short](/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

In addition, you can expend a spell slot (no action required) to regain one expended use of Bardic Inspiration.

#### Level 7: Countercharm {#Level7Countercharm}

You can use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. If you or a creature within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw against an effect that applies the [Charmed](/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) or [Frightened](/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition, you can take a Reaction to cause the save to be rerolled, and the new roll has [Advantage](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage).

#### Level 10: Magical Secrets {#Level10MagicalSecrets}

You’ve learned secrets from various magical traditions. Whenever you reach a Bard level (including this level) and the Prepared Spells number in the Bard Features table increases, you can choose any of your new prepared spells from the [Bard](/free-rules/character-classes#BardSpellList), [Cleric](/free-rules/character-classes#ClericSpellList), [Druid](/free-rules/character-classes#DruidSpellList), and [Wizard](/free-rules/character-classes#WizardSpellList) spell lists, and the chosen spells count as Bard spells for you (see a class’s section for its spell list). In addition, whenever you replace a spell prepared for this class, you can replace it with a spell from those lists.

#### Level 18: Superior Inspiration {#Level18SuperiorInspiration}

When you roll Initiative, you regain expended uses of Bardic Inspiration until you have two if you have fewer than that.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon {#Level19BardEpicBoon}

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](/free-rules/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Spell Recall](/free-rules/feats#BoonofSpellRecall) is recommended.

#### Level 20: Words of Creation {#Level20WordsofCreation}

You have mastered two of the Words of Creation: the words of life and death. You therefore always have the [Power Word Heal](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618880-power-word-heal) and [Power Word Kill](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618886-power-word-kill) spells prepared. When you cast either spell, you can target a second creature with it if that creature is within 10 feet of the first target.

### Bard Spell List {#BardSpellList}

This section presents the Bard spell list. The spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell’s school of magic is listed. In the Special column, *C* means the spell requires Concentration, *R* means it’s a Ritual, and *M* means it requires a specific Material component.

### Bard Subclass {#BardSubclass}

A Bard subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Bard levels, as specified in the subclass. Bards form loose associations, which they call colleges, to preserve their traditions. This section presents the College of Lore subclass.

#### College of Lore {#CollegeofLore}

_Plumb the Depths of Magical Knowledge_

Bards of the College of Lore collect spells and secrets from diverse sources, such as scholarly tomes, mystical rites, and peasant tales. The college’s members gather in libraries and universities to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.

##### Level 3: Bonus Proficiencies {#Level3BonusProficiencies}

You gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.

##### Level 3: Cutting Words {#Level3CuttingWords}

You learn to use your wit to supernaturally distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of yourself makes a damage roll or succeeds on an ability check or attack roll, you can take a Reaction to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration; roll your Bardic Inspiration die, and subtract the number rolled from the creature’s roll, reducing the damage or potentially turning the success into a failure.

##### Level 6: Magical Discoveries {#Level6MagicalDiscoveries}

You learn two spells of your choice. These spells can come from the [Cleric](/free-rules/character-classes#ClericSpellList), [Druid](/free-rules/character-classes#DruidSpellList), or [Wizard](/free-rules/character-classes#WizardSpellList) spell list or any combination thereof (see a class’s section for its spell list). A spell you choose must be a cantrip or a spell for which you have spell slots, as shown in the [Bard Features table](/free-rules/character-classes#BardFeatures).

You always have the chosen spells prepared, and whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of the spells with another spell that meets these requirements.

##### Level 14: Peerless Skill {#Level14PeerlessSkill}

When you make an ability check or attack roll and fail, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration; roll the Bardic Inspiration die, and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning a failure into a success. On a failure, the Bardic Inspiration isn’t expended.

Clerics draw power from the realms of the gods and harness it to work miracles. Blessed by a deity, a pantheon, or another immortal entity, a Cleric can reach out to the divine magic of the Outer Planes—where gods dwell—and channel it to bolster people and battle foes.

Because their power is a divine gift, Clerics typically associate themselves with temples dedicated to the deity or other immortal force that unlocked their magic. Harnessing divine magic doesn’t rely on specific training, yet Clerics might learn prayers and rites that help them draw on power from the Outer Planes.

Not every member of a temple or shrine is a Cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their devotion through prayer and rituals, not through magic. Many mortals claim to speak for the gods, but few can marshal the power of those gods the way a Cleric can.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting {#Level1ClericSpellcasting}

You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See [chapter 7](/free-rules/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Cleric spells, which appear on the [Cleric spell list](/free-rules/character-classes#ClericSpellList) later in the class’s description.

**_Cantrips._** You know three cantrips of your choice from the Cleric spell list. [Guidance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618971-guidance), [Sacred Flame](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618967-sacred-flame), and [Thaumaturgy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619174-thaumaturgy) are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Cleric level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list.

When you reach Cleric levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the [Cleric Features table](/free-rules/character-classes#ClericFeatures).

**_Spell Slots._** The Cleric Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

**_Prepared Spells of Level 1+._** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Cleric spell list. [Bless](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618933-bless), [Cure Wounds](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619079-cure-wounds), [Guiding Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619136-guiding-bolt), and [Shield of Faith](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619020-shield-of-faith) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the [Cleric Features table](/free-rules/character-classes#ClericFeatures). Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Cleric spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Cleric, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Cleric feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Cleric spells for you.

**_Changing Your Prepared Spells._** Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Cleric spells for which you have spell slots.

**_Spellcasting Ability._** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Cleric spells.

**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use a [Holy Symbol](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/514-holy-symbol) as a Spellcasting Focus for your Cleric spells.

#### Level 1: Divine Order {#Level1DivineOrder}

You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice.

**_Protector._** Trained for battle, you gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Heavy armor.

**_Thaumaturge._** You know one extra cantrip from the [Cleric spell list](/free-rules/character-classes#ClericSpellList). In addition, your mystical connection to the divine gives you a bonus to your Intelligence ([Arcana](/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) or [Religion](/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).

#### Level 2: Channel Divinity {#Level2ClericChannelDivinity}

You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Divine Spark and Turn Undead, each of which is described below. Each time you use this class’s Channel Divinity, choose which Channel Divinity effect from this class to create. You gain additional effect options at higher Cleric levels.

You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a [Short Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). You gain additional uses when you reach certain Cleric levels, as shown in the Channel Divinity column of the [Cleric Features table](/free-rules/character-classes#ClericFeatures).

If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class’s Spellcasting feature.

**_Divine Spark._** As a [Magic](/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you point your Holy Symbol at another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy at it. Roll 1d8 and add your Wisdom modifier. You either restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total or force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice) equal to that total. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage (round down).

You roll an additional d8 when you reach Cleric levels 7 (2d8), 13 (3d8), and 18 (4d8).

**_Turn Undead._** As a [Magic](/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you present your Holy Symbol and censure Undead creatures. Each Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its save, it has the [Frightened](/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) and [Incapacitated](/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) conditions for 1 minute. For that duration, it tries to move as far from you as it can on its turns. This effect ends early on the creature if it takes any damage, if you have the Incapacitated condition, or if you die.

#### Level 3: Cleric Subclass {#Level3ClericSubclass}

You gain a Cleric subclass of your choice. The [Life Domain](/free-rules/character-classes#LifeDomain) subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Cleric levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Cleric level or lower.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement {#Level4ClericAbilityScoreImprovement}

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](/free-rules/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Cleric levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Sear Undead {#Level5SearUndead}

Whenever you use Turn Undead, you can roll a number of d8s equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1d8) and add the rolls together. Each Undead that fails its saving throw against that use of Turn Undead takes Radiant damage equal to the roll’s total. This damage doesn’t end the turn effect.

#### Level 7: Blessed Strikes {#Level7BlessedStrikes}

Divine power infuses you in battle. You gain one of the following options of your choice (if you get either option from a Cleric subclass in an older book, use only the option you choose for this feature).

**_Divine Strike._** Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon, you can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice).

**_Potent Spellcasting._** Add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Cleric cantrip.

#### Level 10: Divine Intervention {#Level10DivineIntervention}

You can call on your deity or pantheon to intervene on your behalf. As a [Magic](/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, choose any Cleric spell of level 5 or lower that doesn’t require a Reaction to cast. As part of the same action, you cast that spell without expending a spell slot or needing Material components. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### Level 14: Improved Blessed Strikes {#Level14ImprovedBlessedStrikes}

The option you chose for Blessed Strikes grows more powerful.

**_Divine Strike._** The extra damage of your Divine Strike increases to 2d8.

**_Potent Spellcasting._** When you cast a Cleric cantrip and deal damage to a creature with it, you can give vitality to yourself or another creature within 60 feet of yourself, granting a number of [Temporary Hit Points](/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to twice your Wisdom modifier.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon {#Level19ClericEpicBoon}

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](/free-rules/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Fate](/free-rules/feats#BoonofFate) is recommended.

#### Level 20: Greater Divine Intervention {#Level20GreaterDivineIntervention}

You can call on even more powerful divine intervention. When you use your Divine Intervention feature, you can choose [Wish](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619213-wish) when you select a spell. If you do so, you can’t use Divine Intervention again until you finish 2d4 [Long Rests](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

### Cleric Spell List {#ClericSpellList}

This section presents the Cleric spell list. The spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell’s school of magic is listed. In the Special column, *C* means the spell requires Concentration, *R* means it’s a Ritual, and *M* means it requires a specific Material component.

### Cleric Subclass {#ClericSubclass}

A Cleric subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Cleric levels, as specified in the subclass. Each Cleric subclass is named after a domain of existence that is favored by a god, pantheon, or religious order. This section presents the [Life Domain](/free-rules/character-classes#LifeDomain) subclass.

#### Life Domain {#LifeDomain}

_Soothe the Hurts of the World_

The Life Domain focuses on the positive energy that helps sustain all life in the multiverse. Clerics who tap into this domain are masters of healing, using that life force to cure many hurts.

Existence itself relies on the positive energy associated with this domain, so a Cleric of almost any religious tradition might choose it. This domain is particularly associated with agricultural deities, gods of healing or endurance, and gods of home and community. Religious orders of healing also seek the magic of this domain.

##### Level 3: Disciple of Life {#Level3DiscipleofLife}

When a spell you cast with a spell slot restores Hit Points to a creature, that creature regains additional Hit Points on the turn you cast the spell. The additional Hit Points equal 2 plus the spell slot’s level.

##### Level 3: Life Domain Spells {#Level3LifeDomainSpells}

Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Life Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Life Domain Spells {#LifeDomainSpells}

| Cleric Level | Prepared Spells                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

##### Level 3: Preserve Life {#Level3PreserveLife}

As a [Magic](/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you present your Holy Symbol and expend a use of your Channel Divinity to evoke healing energy that can restore a number of Hit Points equal to five times your Cleric level. Choose [Bloodied](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Bloodied) creatures within 30 feet of yourself (which can include you), and divide those Hit Points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half its Hit Point maximum.

##### Level 6: Blessed Healer {#Level6BlessedHealer}

The healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. Immediately after you cast a spell with a spell slot that restores Hit Points to one or more creatures other than yourself, you regain Hit Points equal to 2 plus the spell slot’s level.

##### Level 17: Supreme Healing {#Level17SupremeHealing}

When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore Hit Points to a creature with a spell or Channel Divinity, don’t roll those dice for the healing; instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 Hit Points to a creature with a spell, you restore 12.

Druids belong to ancient orders that call on the forces of nature. Harnessing the magic of animals, plants, and the four elements, Druids heal, transform into animals, and wield elemental destruction.

Revering nature above all, individual Druids gain their magic from nature, a nature deity, or both, and they typically unite with other Druids to perform rites that mark the passage of the seasons and other natural cycles.

Druids are concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life and with the need for people to live in harmony with nature. Druids often guard sacred sites or watch over regions of unspoiled nature, but when a significant danger arises, Druids take a more active role as adventurers who combat the threat.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through studying the mystical forces of nature. See [chapter 7](/free-rules/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Druid spells, which appear on the [Druid spell list](/free-rules/character-classes#DruidSpellList) later in the class’s description.

**_Cantrips._** You know two cantrips of your choice from the Druid spell list. [Druidcraft](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619158-druidcraft) and [Produce Flame](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618901-produce-flame) are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Druid level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list.

When you reach Druid levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Druid Features table.

**_Spell Slots._** The Druid Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

**_Prepared Spells of Level 1+._** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Druid spell list. [Animal Friendship](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618847-animal-friendship), [Cure Wounds](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619079-cure-wounds), [Faerie Fire](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618858-faerie-fire), and [Thunderwave](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619184-thunderwave) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Druid levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Druid Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Druid spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Druid, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Druid feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Druid spells for you.

**_Changing Your Prepared Spells._** Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells with other Druid spells for which you have spell slots.

**_Spellcasting Ability._** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Druid spells.

**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use a [Druidic Focus](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/532-druidic-focus) as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells.

#### Level 1: Druidic

You know Druidic, the secret language of Druids. While learning this ancient tongue, you also unlocked the magic of communicating with animals; you always have the [Speak with Animals](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619059-speak-with-animals) spell prepared.

You can use Druidic to leave hidden messages. You and others who know Druidic automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check but can’t decipher it without magic.

#### Level 1: Primal Order

You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice.

**_Magician._** You know one extra cantrip from the [Druid spell list](/free-rules/character-classes#DruidSpellList). In addition, your mystical connection to nature gives you a bonus to your Intelligence ([Arcana](/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) or [Nature](/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum bonus of +1).

**_Warden._** Trained for battle, you gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Medium armor.

#### Level 2: Wild Shape

The power of nature allows you to assume the form of an animal. As a Bonus Action, you shape-shift into a Beast form that you have learned for this feature (see “Known Forms” below). You stay in that form for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level or until you use Wild Shape again, have the [Incapacitated](/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition, or die. You can also leave the form early as a Bonus Action.

**_Number of Uses._** You can use Wild Shape twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a [Short Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

You gain additional uses when you reach certain Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape column of the [Druid Features table](/free-rules/character-classes#DruidFeatures).

**_Known Forms._** You know four Beast forms for this feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1/4 and that lack a Fly Speed (see [appendix B](/free-rules/creature-stat-blocks/) for stat block options). The [Rat](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775836-rat), [Riding Horse](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775839-riding-horse), [Spider](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775844-spider), and [Wolf](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775850-wolf) are recommended. Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can replace one of your known forms with another eligible form.

When you reach certain Druid levels, your number of known forms and the maximum Challenge Rating for those forms increases, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. In addition, starting at level 8, you can adopt a form that has a Fly Speed.

When choosing known forms, you may look in the *Monster Manual* or elsewhere for eligible Beasts if the Dungeon Master permits you to do so.

##### Beast Shapes

| Druid Level | Known Forms | Max CR | Fly Speed |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------ | --------- |
| 2           | 4           | 1/4    | No        |
| 4           | 6           | 1/2    | No        |
| 8           | 8           | 1      | Yes       |

**_Rules While Shape-Shifted._** While in a form, you retain your personality, memories, and ability to speak, and the following rules apply:

**Temporary Hit Points.** When you assume a Wild Shape form, you gain a number of [Temporary Hit Points](/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to your Druid level.

**Game Statistics.** Your game statistics are replaced by the Beast’s stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features; languages; and feats. You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving throw modifier in the Beast’s stat block is higher than yours, use the one in the stat block.

**No Spellcasting.** You can’t cast spells, but shape-shifting doesn’t break your [Concentration](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration) or otherwise interfere with a spell you’ve already cast.

**Objects.** Your ability to handle objects is determined by the form’s limbs rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment falls in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it’s practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment based on the creature’s size and shape. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with the form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect while you’re in that form.

#### Level 2: Wild Companion

You can summon a nature spirit that assumes an animal form to aid you. As a [Magic](/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can expend a spell slot or a use of Wild Shape to cast the [Find Familiar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618877-find-familiar) spell without Material components.

When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is Fey and disappears when you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### Level 3: Druid Subclass

You gain a Druid subclass of your choice. The [Circle of the Land](/free-rules/character-classes#CircleoftheLand) subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Druid levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Druid level or lower.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](/free-rules/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Druid levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Wild Resurgence

Once on each of your turns, if you have no uses of Wild Shape left, you can give yourself one use by expending a spell slot (no action required).

In addition, you can expend one use of Wild Shape (no action required) to give yourself a level 1 spell slot, but you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### Level 7: Elemental Fury

The might of the elements flows through you. You gain one of the following options of your choice.

**_Potent Spellcasting._** Add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Druid cantrip.

**_Primal Strike._** Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon or a Beast form’s attack in Wild Shape, you can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage (choose when you hit).

#### Level 15: Improved Elemental Fury

The option you chose for Elemental Fury grows more powerful, as detailed below.

**_Potent Spellcasting._** When you cast a Druid cantrip with a range of 10 feet or greater, the spell’s range increases by 300 feet.

**_Primal Strike._** The extra damage of your Primal Strike increases to 2d8.

#### Level 18: Beast Spells

While using Wild Shape, you can cast spells in Beast form, except for any spell that has a Material component with a cost specified or that consumes its Material component.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](/free-rules/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Dimensional Travel](/free-rules/feats#BoonofDimensionalTravel) is recommended.

#### Level 20: Archdruid

The vitality of nature constantly blooms within you, granting you the following benefits.

**_Evergreen Wild Shape._** Whenever you roll [Initiative](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Initiative) and have no uses of Wild Shape left, you regain one expended use of it.

**_Nature Magician._** You can convert uses of Wild Shape into a spell slot (no action required). Choose a number of your unexpended uses of Wild Shape and convert them into a single spell slot, with each use contributing 2 spell levels. For example, if you convert two uses of Wild Shape, you produce a level 4 spell slot. Once you use this benefit, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

**_Longevity._** The primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every ten years that pass, your body ages only one year.

### Druid Spell List

This section presents the Druid spell list. The spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell’s school of magic is listed. In the Special column, *C* means the spell requires Concentration, *R* means it’s a Ritual, and *M* means it requires a specific Material component.

### Druid Subclass

A Druid subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Druid levels, as specified in the subclass. Druids form loose associations, which they call circles. This section presents the Circle of the Land subclass.

#### Circle of the Land

_Celebrate Connection to the Natural World_

The Circle of the Land comprises mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites. These Druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of their communities.

##### Level 3: Circle of the Land Spells

Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), choose one type of land: arid, polar, temperate, or tropical. Consult the table below that corresponds to the chosen type; you have the spells listed for your Druid level and lower prepared.

##### Arid Land

##### Level 3: Land’s Aid

As a [Magic](/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape and choose a point within 60 feet of yourself. Vitality-giving flowers and life-draining thorns appear for a moment in a 10-foot-radius [Sphere](/free-rules/rules-glossary#SphereAreaofEffect) centered on that point. Each creature of your choice in the Sphere must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. One creature of your choice in that area regains 2d6 Hit Points.

The damage and healing increase by 1d6 when you reach Druid levels 10 (3d6) and 14 (4d6).

##### Level 6: Natural Recovery

You can cast one of the level 1+ spells that you have prepared from your Circle Spells feature without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) before you do so again.

In addition, when you finish a [Short Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your Druid level (round up), and none of them can be level 6+. For example, if you’re a level 6 Druid, you can recover up to three levels’ worth of spell slots. You can recover a level 3 spell slot, a level 2 and a level 1 spell slot, or three level 1 spell slots. Once you recover spell slots with this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.

##### Level 10: Nature’s Ward

You are immune to the [Poisoned](/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) condition, and you have Resistance to a damage type associated with your current land choice in the Circle Spells feature, as shown in the Nature’s Ward table.

##### Nature’s Ward

| Land Type | Resistance |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Arid      | Fire       |
| Polar     | Cold       |
| Temperate | Lightning  |
| Tropical  | Poison     |

##### Level 14: Nature’s Sanctuary

As a [Magic](/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape and cause spectral trees and vines to appear in a 15-foot [Cube](/free-rules/rules-glossary#CubeAreaofEffect) on the ground within 120 feet of yourself. They last there for 1 minute or until you have the [Incapacitated](/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition or die. You and your allies have [Half Cover](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover) while in that area, and your allies gain the current Resistance of your Nature’s Ward while there.

As a Bonus Action, you can move the Cube up to 60 feet to ground within 120 feet of yourself.

Fighters rule many battlefields. Questing knights, royal champions, elite soldiers, and hardened mercenaries—as Fighters, they all share an unparalleled prowess with weapons and armor. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and defying it.

Fighters master various weapon techniques, and a well-equipped Fighter always has the right tool at hand for any combat situation. Likewise, a Fighter is adept with every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each Fighter specializes in certain styles of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad ability and extensive specialization makes Fighters superior combatants.

#### Level 1: Fighting Style {#Level1FighterFightingStyle}

You have honed your martial prowess and gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (see [chapter 5](/free-rules/feats#FightingStyleFeats)). [Defense](/free-rules/feats#Defense) is recommended.

Whenever you gain a Fighter level, you can replace the feat you chose with a different Fighting Style feat.

You have a limited well of physical and mental stamina that you can draw on. As a Bonus Action, you can use it to regain Hit Points equal to 1d10 plus your Fighter level.

You can use this feature twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a [Short Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

When you reach certain Fighter levels, you gain more uses of this feature, as shown in the Second Wind column of the [Fighter Features table](/free-rules/character-classes#FighterFeatures).

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Short](/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). Starting at level 17, you can use it twice before a rest but only once on a turn.

#### Level 2: Tactical Mind {#Level2TacticalMind}

You have a mind for tactics on and off the battlefield. When you fail an ability check, you can expend a use of your Second Wind to push yourself toward success. Rather than regaining Hit Points, you roll 1d10 and add the number rolled to the ability check, potentially turning it into a success. If the check still fails, this use of Second Wind isn’t expended.

#### Level 3: Fighter Subclass {#Level3FighterSubclass}

You gain a Fighter subclass of your choice. The [Champion](/free-rules/character-classes#Champion) subclass is detailed after this class’s description.

#### Level 9: Indomitable {#Level9Indomitable}

If you fail a saving throw, you can reroll it with a bonus equal to your Fighter level. You must use the new roll, and you can’t use this feature again until you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

You can use this feature twice before a Long Rest starting at level 13 and three times before a Long Rest starting at level 17.

#### Level 9: Tactical Master {#Level9TacticalMaster}

When you attack with a weapon whose mastery property you can use, you can replace that property with the [Push](/free-rules/equipment#Push), [Sap](/free-rules/equipment#Sap), or [Slow](/free-rules/equipment#Slow) property for that attack.

#### Level 11: Two Extra Attacks {#Level11TwoExtraAttacks}

You can attack three times instead of once whenever you take the [Attack](/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn.

#### Level 13: Studied Attacks {#Level13StudiedAttacks}

#### Level 19: Epic Boon {#Level19FighterEpicBoon}

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](/free-rules/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Combat Prowess](/free-rules/feats#BoonofCombatProwess) is recommended.

You can attack four times instead of once whenever you take the [Attack](/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn.

### Fighter Subclass {#FighterSubclass}

A Fighter subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the [Champion](/free-rules/character-classes#Champion) subclass.

#### Champion {#Champion}

_Pursue Physical Excellence in Combat_

A Champion focuses on the development of martial prowess in a relentless pursuit of victory. Champions combine rigorous training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows, withstand peril, and garner glory. Whether in athletic contests or bloody battle, Champions strive for the crown of the victor.

##### Level 3: Improved Critical {#Level3ImprovedCritical}

Your attack rolls with weapons and [Unarmed Strikes](/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) can score a Critical Hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.

##### Level 3: Remarkable Athlete {#Level3RemarkableAthlete}

Thanks to your athleticism, you have [Advantage](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on [Initiative](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Initiative) rolls and Strength ([Athletics](/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks.

##### Level 7: Additional Fighting Style {#Level7AdditionalFightingStyle}

You gain another Fighting Style feat of your choice.

##### Level 10: Heroic Warrior {#Level10HeroicWarrior}

##### Level 15: Superior Critical {#Level15SuperiorCritical}

Your attack rolls with weapons and [Unarmed Strikes](/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) can now score a Critical Hit on a roll of 18–20 on the d20.

##### Level 18: Survivor {#Level18Survivor}

You attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle, giving you these benefits.

**_Defy Death._** You have Advantage on Death Saving Throws. Moreover, when you roll 18–20 on a Death Saving Throw, you gain the benefit of rolling a 20 on it.

**_Heroic Rally._** At the start of each of your turns, you regain Hit Points equal to 5 plus your Constitution modifier if you are [Bloodied](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Bloodied) and have at least 1 Hit Point.

Monks use rigorous combat training and mental discipline to align themselves with the multiverse and focus their internal reservoirs of power. Different Monks conceptualize this power in various ways: as breath, energy, life force, essence, or self, for example. Whether channeled as a striking display of martial prowess or as a subtler manifestation of defense and speed, this power infuses all that a Monk does.

Monks focus their internal power to create extraordinary, even supernatural, effects. They channel uncanny speed and strength into their attacks, with or without the use of weapons. In a Monk’s hands, even the most basic weapons can become sophisticated implements of combat mastery.

Many Monks find that a structured life of ascetic withdrawal helps them cultivate the physical and mental focus they need to harness their power. Other Monks believe that immersing themselves in the vibrant confusion of life helps to fuel their determination and discipline.

Monks generally view adventures as tests of their physical and mental development. They are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering treasure; they strive to turn themselves into living weapons.

#### Level 1: Martial Arts

Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use your [Unarmed Strike](/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) and Monk weapons, which are the following:

- Simple Melee weapons
- Martial Melee weapons that have the [Light](/free-rules/equipment#Light) property

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only Monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a Shield.

**_Bonus Unarmed Strike._** You can make an [Unarmed Strike](/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) as a Bonus Action.

**_Martial Arts Die._** You can roll 1d6 in place of the normal damage of your [Unarmed Strike](/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) or Monk weapons. This die changes as you gain Monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk Features table.

**_Dexterous Attacks._** You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls of your [Unarmed Strikes](/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) and Monk weapons. In addition, when you use the Grapple or Shove option of your Unarmed Strike, you can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to determine the save DC.

#### Level 1: Unarmored Defense

While you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a Shield, your base [Armor Class](/free-rules/rules-glossary#ArmorClass) equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Wisdom modifiers.

#### Level 2: Monk’s Focus

Your focus and martial training allow you to harness a well of extraordinary energy within yourself. This energy is represented by Focus Points. Your Monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Focus Points column of the [Monk Features table](/free-rules/character-classes#MonkFeatures).

You can expend these points to enhance or fuel certain Monk features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind, each of which is detailed below.

When you expend a Focus Point, it is unavailable until you finish a [Short](/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), at the end of which you regain all your expended points.

Some features that use Focus Points require your target to make a saving throw. The save DC equals 8 plus your Wisdom modifier and Proficiency Bonus.

**_Flurry of Blows._** You can expend 1 Focus Point to make two [Unarmed Strikes](/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) as a Bonus Action.

**_Patient Defense._** You can take the [Disengage](/free-rules/rules-glossary#DisengageAction) action as a Bonus Action. Alternatively, you can expend 1 Focus Point to take both the Disengage and the [Dodge](/free-rules/rules-glossary#DodgeAction) actions as a Bonus Action.

**_Step of the Wind._** You can take the [Dash](/free-rules/rules-glossary#DashAction) action as a Bonus Action. Alternatively, you can expend 1 Focus Point to take both the [Disengage](/free-rules/rules-glossary#DisengageAction) and Dash actions as a Bonus Action, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.

#### Level 2: Unarmored Movement

Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a Shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain Monk levels, as shown on the [Monk Features table](/free-rules/character-classes#MonkFeatures).

#### Level 2: Uncanny Metabolism

When you roll [Initiative](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Initiative), you can regain all expended Focus Points. When you do so, roll your Martial Arts die, and regain a number of Hit Points equal to your Monk level plus the number rolled.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### Level 3: Deflect Attacks

When an attack roll hits you and its damage includes Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage, you can take a Reaction to reduce the attack’s total damage against you. The reduction equals 1d10 plus your Dexterity modifier and Monk level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can expend 1 Focus Point to redirect some of the attack’s force. If you do so, choose a creature you can see within 5 feet of yourself if the attack was a melee attack or a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself that isn’t behind [Total Cover](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover) if the attack was a ranged attack. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die plus your Dexterity modifier. The damage is the same type dealt by the attack.

#### Level 3: Monk Subclass

You gain a Monk subclass of your choice. The [Warrior of the Open Hand](/free-rules/character-classes#WarrioroftheOpenHand) subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Monk levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Monk level or lower.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](/free-rules/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Monk levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 4: Slow Fall

You can take a Reaction when you fall to reduce any damage you take from the fall by an amount equal to five times your Monk level.

#### Level 5: Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the [Attack](/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn.

#### Level 5: Stunning Strike

Once per turn when you hit a creature with a Monk weapon or an [Unarmed Strike](/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike), you can expend 1 Focus Point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the [Stunned](/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition) condition until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the target’s Speed is halved until the start of your next turn, and the next attack roll made against the target before then has [Advantage](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage).

#### Level 6: Empowered Strikes

Whenever you deal damage with your [Unarmed Strike](/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike), it can deal your choice of Force damage or its normal damage type.

#### Level 7: Evasion

When you’re subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw and only half damage if you fail.

You don’t benefit from this feature if you have the [Incapacitated](/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition.

#### Level 9: Acrobatic Movement

While you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a Shield, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the movement.

#### Level 10: Heightened Focus

Your Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind gain the following benefits.

**_Flurry of Blows._** You can expend 1 Focus Point to use Flurry of Blows and make three [Unarmed Strikes](/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike) with it instead of two.

**_Patient Defense._** When you expend a Focus Point to use Patient Defense, you gain a number of [Temporary Hit Points](/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die.

**_Step of the Wind._** When you expend a Focus Point to use Step of the Wind, you can choose a willing creature within 5 feet of yourself that is Large or smaller. You move the creature with you until the end of your turn. The creature’s movement doesn’t provoke [Opportunity Attacks](/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack).

#### Level 10: Self-Restoration

Through sheer force of will, you can remove one of the following conditions from yourself at the end of each of your turns: [Charmed](/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition), [Frightened](/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition), or [Poisoned](/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition).

In addition, forgoing food and drink doesn’t give you levels of [Exhaustion](/free-rules/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition).

#### Level 13: Deflect Energy

You can now use your Deflect Attacks feature against attacks that deal any damage type, not just Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing.

#### Level 14: Disciplined Survivor

Your physical and mental discipline grant you proficiency in all saving throws.

Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can expend 1 Focus Point to reroll it, and you must use the new roll.

#### Level 15: Perfect Focus

When you roll [Initiative](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Initiative) and don’t use Uncanny Metabolism, you regain expended Focus Points until you have 4 if you have 3 or fewer.

#### Level 18: Superior Defense

At the start of your turn, you can expend 3 Focus Points to bolster yourself against harm for 1 minute or until you have the [Incapacitated](/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition. During that time, you have Resistance to all damage except Force damage.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](/free-rules/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Irresistible Offense](/free-rules/feats#BoonofIrresistibleOffense) is recommended.

#### Level 20: Body and Mind

You have developed your body and mind to new heights. Your Dexterity and Wisdom scores increase by 4, to a maximum of 25.

### Monk Subclass

A Monk subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the Warrior of the Open Hand subclass.

#### Warrior of the Open Hand

_Master Unarmed Combat Techniques_

Warriors of the Open Hand are masters of unarmed combat. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents and manipulate their own energy to protect themselves from harm.

##### Level 3: Open Hand Technique

Whenever you hit a creature with an attack granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target.

**_Addle._** The target can’t make [Opportunity Attacks](/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack) until the start of its next turn.

**_Push._** The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet away from you.

**_Topple._** The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the [Prone](/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition.

##### Level 6: Wholeness of Body

You gain the ability to heal yourself. As a Bonus Action, you can roll your Martial Arts die. You regain a number of Hit Points equal to the number rolled plus your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 Hit Point regained).

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

##### Level 11: Fleet Step

When you take a Bonus Action other than Step of the Wind, you can also use Step of the Wind immediately after that Bonus Action.

##### Level 17: Quivering Palm

You gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone’s body. When you hit a creature with an [Unarmed Strike](/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike), you can expend 4 Focus Points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your Monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you take an action to end them. Alternatively, when you take the [Attack](/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn, you can forgo one of the attacks to end the vibrations. To end them, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you end them, the target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d12 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can end the vibrations harmlessly (no action required).

Paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of annihilation and corruption. Whether sworn before a god’s altar, in a sacred glade before nature spirits, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witnesses, a Paladin’s oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.

Paladins train to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the injured, smite their foes, and protect the helpless and those who fight at their side.

Almost by definition, the life of a Paladin is an adventuring life, for every Paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against annihilation. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of a world’s armies, but even fewer people can claim the calling of a Paladin. When they do receive the call, these blessed folk turn from their former occupations and take up arms and magic.

#### Level 1: Lay On Hands {#Level1LayOnHands}

Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). With that pool, you can restore a total number of Hit Points equal to five times your Paladin level.

As a Bonus Action, you can touch a creature (which could be yourself) and draw power from the pool of healing to restore a number of Hit Points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in the pool.

You can also expend 5 Hit Points from the pool of healing power to remove the [Poisoned](/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) condition from the creature; those points don’t also restore Hit Points to the creature.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting {#Level1PaladinSpellcasting}

You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See [chapter 7](/free-rules/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Paladin spells, which appear in the [Paladin spell list](/free-rules/character-classes#PaladinSpellList) later in the class’s description.

**_Spell Slots._** The [Paladin Features table](/free-rules/character-classes#PaladinFeatures) shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

**_Prepared Spells of Level 1+_**. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Paladin spells. [Heroism](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619151-heroism) and [Searing Smite](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619009-searing-smite) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Paladin levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the [Paladin Features table](/free-rules/character-classes#PaladinFeatures). Whenever that number increases, choose additional Paladin spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Paladin Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 5 Paladin, your list of prepared spells can include six Paladin spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Paladin feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Paladin spells for you.

**_Changing Your Prepared Spells._** Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can replace one spell on your list with another Paladin spell for which you have spell slots.

**_Spellcasting Ability._** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Paladin spells.

**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use a [Holy Symbol](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/514-holy-symbol) as a Spellcasting Focus for your Paladin spells.

#### Level 1: Weapon Mastery {#Level1PaladinWeaponMastery}

Your training with weapons allows you to use the [mastery properties](/free-rules/equipment#MasteryProperties) of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Longswords and Javelins.

Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Halberds and Flails.

#### Level 2: Fighting Style {#Level2PaladinFightingStyle}

You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (see [chapter 5](/free-rules/feats#FightingStyleFeats) for feats). Instead of choosing one of those feats, you can choose the option below.

**_Blessed Warrior._** You learn two Cleric cantrips of your choice (see the Cleric class’s section for a [list of Cleric spells](/free-rules/character-classes#ClericSpellList)). [Guidance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618971-guidance) and [Sacred Flame](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618967-sacred-flame) are recommended. The chosen cantrips count as Paladin spells for you, and Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a Paladin level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another Cleric cantrip.

#### Level 2: Paladin’s Smite {#Level2PaladinsSmite}

You always have the [Divine Smite](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618833-divine-smite) spell prepared. In addition, you can cast it without expending a spell slot, but you must finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) before you can cast it in this way again.

#### Level 3: Channel Divinity {#Level3ChannelDivinity}

You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes, using it to fuel magical effects. You start with one such effect: Divine Sense, which is described below. Other Paladin features give additional Channel Divinity effect options. Each time you use this class’s Channel Divinity, you choose which effect from this class to create.

You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a [Short Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). You gain an additional use when you reach Paladin level 11.

If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class’s Spellcasting feature.

**_Divine Sense._** As a Bonus Action, you can open your awareness to detect Celestials, Fiends, and Undead. For the next 10 minutes or until you have the [Incapacitated](/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition, you know the location of any creature of those types within 60 feet of yourself, and you know its creature type. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the [Hallow](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619138-hallow) spell.

#### Level 3: Paladin Subclass {#Level3PaladinSubclass}

You gain a Paladin subclass of your choice. The [Oath of Devotion](/free-rules/character-classes#OathofDevotion) subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Paladin levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Paladin level or lower.

Breaking Your Oath

A Paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most dedicated are fallible. Sometimes a Paladin transgresses their oath.

A Paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution, spending an all-night vigil as a sign of penitence or undertaking a fast. After a rite of forgiveness, the Paladin starts fresh.

If your Paladin unrepentantly violates their oath, talk to your DM. Your Paladin should probably take a more appropriate subclass or even abandon the class and adopt another one.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement {#Level4PaladinAbilityScoreImprovement}

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](/free-rules/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Paladin levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Extra Attack {#Level5PaladinExtraAttack}

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the [Attack](/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn.

#### Level 5: Faithful Steed {#Level5FaithfulSteed}

You can call on the aid of an otherworldly steed. You always have the [Find Steed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618879-find-steed) spell prepared.

You can also cast the spell once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### Level 6: Aura of Protection {#Level6AuraofProtection}

You radiate a protective, unseeable aura in a 10-foot [Emanation](/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect) that originates from you. The aura is inactive while you have the [Incapacitated](/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition.

You and your allies in the aura gain a bonus to saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum bonus of +1).

If another Paladin is present, a creature can benefit from only one Aura of Protection at a time; the creature chooses which aura while in them.

#### Level 9: Abjure Foes {#Level9AbjureFoes}

As a [Magic](/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can expend one use of this class’s Channel Divinity to overwhelm foes with awe. As you present your Holy Symbol or weapon, you can target a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature) that you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [Frightened](/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While Frightened in this way, a target can do only one of the following on its turns: move, take an action, or take a Bonus Action.

#### Level 10: Aura of Courage {#Level10AuraofCourage}

You and your allies have Immunity to the [Frightened](/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition) condition while in your Aura of Protection. If a Frightened ally enters the aura, that condition has no effect on that ally while there.

#### Level 11: Radiant Strikes {#Level11RadiantStrikes}

Your strikes now carry supernatural power. When you hit a target with an attack roll using a Melee weapon or an [Unarmed Strike](/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike), the target takes an extra 1d8 Radiant damage.

#### Level 14: Restoring Touch {#Level14RestoringTouch}

When you use Lay On Hands on a creature, you can also remove one or more of the following conditions from the creature: [Blinded](/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition), [Charmed](/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition), [Deafened](/free-rules/rules-glossary#DeafenedCondition), [Frightened](/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition), [Paralyzed](/free-rules/rules-glossary#ParalyzedCondition), or [Stunned](/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition). You must expend 5 Hit Points from the healing pool of Lay On Hands for each of these conditions you remove; those points don’t also restore Hit Points to the creature.

#### Level 18: Aura Expansion {#Level18AuraExpansion}

Your Aura of Protection is now a 30-foot [Emanation](/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect).

#### Level 19: Epic Boon {#Level19PaladinEpicBoon}

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](/free-rules/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Truesight](/free-rules/feats#BoonofsenseTruesightsense) is recommended.

### Paladin Spell List {#PaladinSpellList}

This section presents the Paladin spell list. The spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell’s school of magic is listed. In the Special column, *C* means the spell requires Concentration, *R* means it’s a Ritual, and *M* means it requires a specific Material component.

### Paladin Subclass {#PaladinSubclass}

A Paladin subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Paladin levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the [Oath of Devotion](/free-rules/character-classes#OathofDevotion) subclass.

This subclass represents a body of oaths that a Paladin begins taking upon joining the class. The final oath, taken at level 3, is the culmination of a Paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true Paladins until they’ve reached level 3 and made this oath. For others, the swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what was already in their hearts.

#### Oath of Devotion {#OathofDevotion}

_Uphold the Ideals of Justice and Order_

The Oath of Devotion binds Paladins to the ideals of justice and order. These Paladins meet the archetype of the knight in shining armor. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some—for better or worse—hold the rest of the world to the same standards.

Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of personal devotion. Others hold angels as their ideals and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.

These paladins share the following tenets:

- Let your word be your promise.
- Protect the weak and never fear to act.
- Let your honorable deeds be an example.

##### Level 3: Oath of Devotion Spells {#Level3OathofDevotionSpells}

The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oath of Devotion Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Oath of Devotion Spells {#OathofDevotionSpells}

##### Level 3: Sacred Weapon {#Level3SacredWeapon}

When you take the [Attack](/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to imbue one Melee weapon that you are holding with positive energy. For 10 minutes or until you use this feature again, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls you make with that weapon (minimum bonus of +1), and each time you hit with it, you cause it to deal its normal damage type or Radiant damage.

The weapon also emits [Bright Light](/free-rules/rules-glossary#BrightLight) in a 20-foot radius and [Dim Light](/free-rules/rules-glossary#DimLight) 20 feet beyond that.

You can end this effect early (no action required). This effect also ends if you aren’t carrying the weapon.

##### Level 7: Aura of Devotion {#Level7AuraofDevotion}

You and your allies have Immunity to the [Charmed](/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition) condition while in your Aura of Protection. If a Charmed ally enters the aura, that condition has no effect on that ally while there.

##### Level 15: Smite of Protection {#Level15SmiteofProtection}

Your magical smite now radiates protective energy. Whenever you cast [Divine Smite](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618833-divine-smite), you and your allies have [Half Cover](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover) while in your Aura of Protection. The aura has this benefit until the start of your next turn.

##### Level 20: Holy Nimbus {#Level20HolyNimbus}

As a Bonus Action, you can imbue your Aura of Protection with holy power, granting the benefits below for 10 minutes or until you end them (no action required). Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot (no action required).

**_Holy Ward._** You have [Advantage](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on any saving throw you are forced to make by a Fiend or an Undead.

**_Radiant Damage._** Whenever an enemy starts its turn in the aura, that creature takes Radiant damage equal to your Charisma modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus.

**_Sunlight._** The aura is filled with [Bright Light](/free-rules/rules-glossary#BrightLight) that is sunlight.

Far from bustling cities, amid the trees of trackless forests and across wide plains, Rangers keep their unending watch in the wilderness. Rangers learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble.

Thanks to their connection with nature, Rangers can also cast spells that harness primal powers of the wilderness. A Ranger’s talents and magic are honed with deadly focus to protect the world from the ravages of monsters and tyrants.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting {#Level1RangerSpellcasting}

You have learned to channel the magical essence of nature to cast spells. See [chapter 7](/free-rules/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Ranger spells, which appear in the [Ranger spell list](/free-rules/character-classes#RangerSpellList) later in the class’s description.

**_Spell Slots._** The [Ranger Features table](/free-rules/character-classes#RangerFeatures) shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

**_Prepared Spells of Level 1+_**. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Ranger spells. [Cure Wounds](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619079-cure-wounds) and [Ensnaring Strike](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619172-ensnaring-strike) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Ranger levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the [Ranger Features table](/free-rules/character-classes#RangerFeatures). Whenever that number increases, choose additional Ranger spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Ranger Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 5 Ranger, your list of prepared spells can include six Ranger spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Ranger feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Ranger spells for you.

**_Changing Your Prepared Spells._** Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can replace one spell on your list with another Ranger spell for which you have spell slots.

**_Spellcasting Ability._** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Ranger spells.

**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use a [Druidic Focus](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/532-druidic-focus) as a Spellcasting Focus for your Ranger spells.

#### Level 1: Favored Enemy {#Level1FavoredEnemy}

You always have the [Hunter’s Mark](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619166-hunters-mark) spell prepared. You can cast it twice without expending a spell slot, and you regain all expended uses of this ability when you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

The number of times you can cast the spell without a spell slot increases when you reach certain Ranger levels, as shown in the Favored Enemy column of the [Ranger Features table](/free-rules/character-classes#RangerFeatures).

#### Level 1: Weapon Mastery {#Level1RangerWeaponMastery}

Your training with weapons allows you to use the [mastery properties](/free-rules/equipment#MasteryProperties) of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Longbows and Shortswords.

Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Scimitars and Longswords.

#### Level 2: Deft Explorer {#Level2DeftExplorer}

Thanks to your travels, you gain the following benefits.

**_Expertise._** Choose one of your skill proficiencies with which you lack [Expertise](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Expertise). You gain Expertise in that skill.

**_Languages._** You know two languages of your choice from the language tables in [chapter 2](/free-rules/creating-a-character#ChooseLanguages).

#### Level 2: Fighting Style {#Level2RangerFightingStyle}

You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (see [chapter 5](/free-rules/feats#FightingStyleFeats)). Instead of choosing one of those feats, you can choose the option below.

**_Druidic Warrior._** You learn two Druid cantrips of your choice (see the Druid class’s section for a [list of Druid spells](/free-rules/character-classes#DruidSpellList)). [Guidance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618971-guidance) and [Starry Wisp](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618840-starry-wisp) are recommended. The chosen cantrips count as Ranger spells for you, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a Ranger level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another Druid cantrip.

#### Level 3: Ranger Subclass {#Level3RangerSubclass}

You gain a Ranger subclass of your choice. The [Hunter](/free-rules/character-classes#Hunter) subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Ranger levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Ranger level or lower.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement {#Level4RangerAbilityScoreImprovement}

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](/free-rules/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Ranger levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Extra Attack {#Level5RangerExtraAttack}

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the [Attack](/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn.

#### Level 6: Roving {#Level6Roving}

Your Speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing Heavy armor. You also have a Climb Speed and a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.

#### Level 9: Expertise {#Level9RangerExpertise}

Choose two of your skill proficiencies with which you lack [Expertise](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Expertise). You gain Expertise in those skills.

#### Level 10: Tireless {#Level10Tireless}

Primal forces now help fuel you on your journeys, granting you the following benefits.

**_Temporary Hit Points._** As a [Magic](/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can give yourself a number of [Temporary Hit Points](/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). You can use this action a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

**_Decrease Exhaustion._** Whenever you finish a [Short Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), your [Exhaustion](/free-rules/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition) level, if any, decreases by 1.

#### Level 13: Relentless Hunter {#Level13RelentlessHunter}

Taking damage can’t break your [Concentration](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration) on [Hunter’s Mark](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619166-hunters-mark).

#### Level 14: Nature’s Veil {#Level14NaturesVeil}

You invoke spirits of nature to magically hide yourself. As a Bonus Action, you can give yourself the [Invisible](/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) condition until the end of your next turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### Level 17: Precise Hunter {#Level17PreciseHunter}

You have [Advantage](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on attack rolls against the creature currently marked by your [Hunter’s Mark](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619166-hunters-mark).

#### Level 18: Feral Senses {#Level18FeralSenses}

### Ranger Subclass {#RangerSubclass}

A Ranger subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Ranger levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the [Hunter](/free-rules/character-classes#Hunter) subclass.

#### Hunter {#Hunter}

_Protect Nature and People from Destruction_

You stalk prey in the wilds and elsewhere, using your abilities as a Hunter to protect nature and people everywhere from forces that would destroy them.

##### Level 3: Hunter’s Lore {#Level3HuntersLore}

You can call on the forces of nature to reveal certain strengths and weaknesses of your prey. While a creature is marked by your [Hunter’s Mark](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619166-hunters-mark), you know whether that creature has any Immunities, Resistances, or Vulnerabilities, and if the creature has any, you know what they are.

##### Level 3: Hunter’s Prey {#Level3HuntersPrey}

You gain one of the following feature options of your choice. Whenever you finish a [Short](/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can replace the chosen option with the other one.

**_Colossus Slayer._** Your tenacity can wear down even the most resilient foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon, the weapon deals an extra 1d8 damage to the target if it’s missing any of its Hit Points. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.

**_Horde Breaker._** Once on each of your turns when you make an attack with a weapon, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target, that is within the weapon’s range, and that you haven’t attacked this turn.

##### Level 7: Defensive Tactics {#Level7DefensiveTactics}

You gain one of the following feature options of your choice. Whenever you finish a [Short](/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can replace the chosen option with the other one.

**_Escape the Horde._** [Opportunity Attacks](/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack) have [Disadvantage](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) against you.

**_Multiattack Defense._** When a creature hits you with an attack roll, that creature has [Disadvantage](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on all other attack rolls against you this turn.

##### Level 11: Superior Hunter’s Prey {#Level11SuperiorHuntersPrey}

Once per turn when you deal damage to a creature marked by your [Hunter’s Mark](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619166-hunters-mark), you can also deal that spell’s extra damage to a different creature that you can see within 30 feet of the first creature.

##### Level 15: Superior Hunter’s Defense {#Level15SuperiorHuntersDefense}

When you take damage, you can take a Reaction to give yourself Resistance to that damage and any other damage of the same type until the end of the current turn.

Rogues rely on cunning, stealth, and their foes’ vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem. A few even learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities. Many Rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.

In combat, Rogues prioritize subtle strikes over brute strength. They would rather make one precise strike than wear an opponent down with a barrage of blows.

Some Rogues began their careers as criminals, while others used their cunning to fight crime. Whatever a Rogue’s relation to the law, no common criminal or officer of the law can match the subtle brilliance of the greatest Rogues.

#### Level 1: Expertise {#LevelRogue1Expertise}

You gain [Expertise](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Expertise) in two of your skill proficiencies of your choice. [Sleight of Hand](/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) and [Stealth](/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills) are recommended if you have proficiency in them.

At Rogue level 6, you gain Expertise in two more of your skill proficiencies of your choice.

#### Level 1: Sneak Attack {#Level1SneakAttack}

You know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack roll if you have [Advantage](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on the roll and the attack uses a [Finesse](/free-rules/equipment#Finesse) or a [Ranged](/free-rules/equipment#Range) weapon. The extra damage’s type is the same as the weapon’s type.

You don’t need [Advantage](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on the attack roll if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the target, the ally doesn’t have the [Incapacitated](/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition, and you don’t have [Disadvantage](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on the attack roll.

The extra damage increases as you gain Rogue levels, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the [Rogue Features table](/free-rules/character-classes#RogueFeatures).

#### Level 1: Thieves’ Cant {#Level1ThievesCant}

You picked up various languages in the communities where you plied your roguish talents. You know Thieves’ Cant and one other language of your choice, which you choose from the language tables in [chapter 2](/free-rules/creating-a-character#ChooseLanguages).

#### Level 1: Weapon Mastery {#Level1RogueWeaponMastery}

Your training with weapons allows you to use the [mastery properties](/free-rules/equipment#MasteryProperties) of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Daggers and Shortbows.

Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Scimitars and Shortswords.

#### Level 2: Cunning Action {#Level2CunningAction}

Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. On your turn, you can take one of the following actions as a Bonus Action: [Dash](/free-rules/rules-glossary#DashAction), [Disengage](/free-rules/rules-glossary#DisengageAction), or [Hide](/free-rules/rules-glossary#HideAction).

#### Level 3: Rogue Subclass {#Level3RogueSubclass}

You gain a Rogue subclass of your choice. The [Arcane Trickster](/free-rules/character-classes#ArcaneTrickster), [Assassin](/free-rules/character-classes#Assassin), [Soulknife](/free-rules/character-classes#Soulknife), and [Thief](/free-rules/character-classes#Thief) subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Rogue levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Rogue level or lower.

#### Level 3: Steady Aim {#Level3SteadyAim}

As a Bonus Action, you give yourself [Advantage](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this feature only if you haven’t moved during this turn, and after you use it, your Speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement {#Level4RogueAbilityScoreImprovement}

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](/free-rules/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Rogue levels 8, 10, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Cunning Strike {#Level5CunningStrike}

You’ve developed cunning ways to use your Sneak Attack. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you can add one of the following Cunning Strike effects. Each effect has a die cost, which is the number of Sneak Attack damage dice you must forgo to add the effect. You remove the die before rolling, and the effect occurs immediately after the attack’s damage is dealt. For example, if you add the Poison effect, remove 1d6 from the Sneak Attack’s damage before rolling.

If a Cunning Strike effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus.

**_Poison (Cost: 1d6)._** You add a toxin to your strike, forcing the target to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the [Poisoned](/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition) condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the Poisoned target repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.

To use this effect, you must have a [Poisoner’s Kit](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/492-poisoners-kit) on your person.

**_Trip (Cost: 1d6)._** If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the [Prone](/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition.

**_Withdraw (Cost: 1d6)._** Immediately after the attack, you move up to half your Speed without provoking [Opportunity Attacks](/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack).

#### Level 5: Uncanny Dodge {#Level5UncannyDodge}

When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you (round down).

#### Level 7: Evasion {#Level7RogueEvasion}

You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain dangers. When you’re subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw and only half damage if you fail. You can’t use this feature if you have the [Incapacitated](/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition.

#### Level 7: Reliable Talent {#Level7ReliableTalent}

Whenever you make an ability check that uses one of your skill or tool proficiencies, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

#### Level 11: Improved Cunning Strike {#Level11ImprovedCunningStrike}

You can use up to two Cunning Strike effects when you deal Sneak Attack damage, paying the die cost for each effect.

#### Level 14: Devious Strikes {#Level14DeviousStrikes}

You’ve practiced new ways to use your Sneak Attack deviously. The following effects are now among your Cunning Strike options.

**_Daze (Cost: 2d6)._** The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or on its next turn, it can do only one of the following: move or take an action or a Bonus Action.

**_Knock Out (Cost: 6d6)._** The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it has the [Unconscious](/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition) condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. The Unconscious target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**_Obscure (Cost: 3d6)._** The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, or it has the [Blinded](/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition) condition until the end of its next turn.

#### Level 15: Slippery Mind {#Level15SlipperyMind}

Your cunning mind is exceptionally difficult to control. You gain proficiency in Wisdom and Charisma saving throws.

#### Level 18: Elusive {#Level18Elusive}

You’re so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll can have [Advantage](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) against you unless you have the [Incapacitated](/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon {#Level19RogueEpicBoon}

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](/free-rules/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of the Night Spirit](/free-rules/feats#BoonoftheNightSpirit) is recommended.

#### Level 20: Stroke of Luck {#Level20StrokeofLuck}

You have a marvelous knack for succeeding when you need to. If you fail a [D20 Test](/free-rules/rules-glossary#D20Test), you can turn the roll into a 20.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Short](/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

### Rogue Subclass {#RogueSubclass}

A Rogue subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Rogue levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the [Thief](/free-rules/character-classes#Thief) subclass.

#### Thief {#Thief}

_Hunt for Treasure as a Classic Adventurer_

A mix of burglar, treasure hunter, and explorer, you are the epitome of an adventurer. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you gain abilities useful for delving into ruins and getting maximum benefit from the magic items you find there.

##### Level 3: Fast Hands {#Level3FastHands}

As a Bonus Action, you can do one of the following.

**_Sleight of Hand._** Make a Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check to pick a lock or disarm a trap with Thieves’ Tools or to pick a pocket.

**_Use an Object._** Take the [Utilize](/free-rules/rules-glossary#UtilizeAction) action, or take the [Magic](/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action to use a magic item that requires that action.

##### Level 3: Second-Story Work {#Level3SecondStoryWork}

You’ve trained to get into especially hard-to-reach places, granting you these benefits.

**_Climber._** You gain a Climb Speed equal to your Speed.

**_Jumper._** You can determine your jump distance using your Dexterity rather than your Strength.

##### Level 9: Supreme Sneak {#Level9SupremeSneak}

You gain the following Cunning Strike option.

**_Stealth Attack (Cost: 1d6)._** If you have the [Hide](/free-rules/rules-glossary#HideAction) action’s [Invisible](/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) condition, this attack doesn’t end that condition on you if you end the turn behind [Three-Quarters Cover](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover) or [Total Cover](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover).

##### Level 13: Use Magic Device {#Level13UseMagicDevice}

You’ve learned how to maximize use of magic items, granting you the following benefits.

**_Attunement._** You can attune to up to four magic items at once.

**_Charges._** Whenever you use a magic item property that expends charges, roll 1d6. On a roll of 6, you use the property without expending the charges.

**_Scrolls._** You can use any [Spell Scroll](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9229085-spell-scroll), using Intelligence as your spellcasting ability for the spell. If the spell is a cantrip or a level 1 spell, you can cast it reliably. If the scroll contains a higher-level spell, you must first succeed on an Intelligence ([Arcana](/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check (DC 10 plus the spell’s level). On a successful check, you cast the spell from the scroll. On a failed check, the scroll disintegrates.

##### Level 17: Thief’s Reflexes {#Level17ThiefsReflexes}

You are adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal [Initiative](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Initiative) and your second turn at your Initiative minus 10.

Sorcerers wield innate magic that is stamped into their being. Some Sorcerers can’t name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their personal or family history. The blessing of a dragon or a dryad at a baby’s birth or the strike of lightning from a clear sky might spark a Sorcerer’s gift. So too might the gift of a deity, exposure to the strange magic of another plane of existence, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality. Whatever the origin, the result is an indelible mark on the Sorcerer, a churning magic that can be passed down through generations.

Sorcerers don’t learn magic; the raw, roiling power of magic is part of them. The essential art of a Sorcerer is learning to harness and channel that innate magic, allowing the Sorcerer to discover new and staggering ways to unleash their power. As Sorcerers master their innate magic, they grow more attuned to its origin, developing distinct powers that reflect its source.

Sorcerers are rare. Some family lines produce exactly one Sorcerer in every generation, but most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as a fluke. People who have this magical power soon discover that it doesn’t like to stay quiet. A Sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting {#Level1SorcererSpellcasting}

Drawing from your innate magic, you can cast spells. See [chapter 7](/free-rules/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Sorcerer spells, which appear in the [Sorcerer spell list](/free-rules/character-classes#SorcererSpellList) later in the class’s description.

**_Cantrips._** You know four Sorcerer cantrips of your choice. [Light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618996-light), [Prestidigitation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618893-prestidigitation), [Shocking Grasp](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618986-shocking-grasp), and [Sorcerous Burst](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618839-sorcerous-burst) are recommended. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Sorcerer levels 4 and 10, you learn another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the [Sorcerer Features table](/free-rules/character-classes#SorcererFeatures).

**_Spell Slots._** The Sorcerer Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

**_Prepared Spells of Level 1+._** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Sorcerer spells. [Burning Hands](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618946-burning-hands) and [Detect Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619097-detect-magic) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Sorcerer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the [Sorcerer Features table](/free-rules/character-classes#SorcererFeatures). Whenever that number increases, choose additional Sorcerer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Sorcerer Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Sorcerer, your list of prepared spells can include six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.

If another Sorcerer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Sorcerer spells for you.

**_Changing Your Prepared Spells._** Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Sorcerer spell for which you have spell slots.

**_Spellcasting Ability._** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Sorcerer spells.

**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use an [Arcane Focus](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/544-arcane-focus) as a Spellcasting Focus for your Sorcerer spells.

#### Level 1: Innate Sorcery {#Level1InnateSorcery}

An event in your past left an indelible mark on you, infusing you with simmering magic. As a Bonus Action, you can unleash that magic for 1 minute, during which you gain the following benefits:

- The spell save DC of your Sorcerer spells increases by 1.
- You have [Advantage](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on the attack rolls of Sorcerer spells you cast.

You can use this feature twice, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### Level 2: Font of Magic {#Level2FontofMagic}

You can tap into the wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by Sorcery Points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.

You have 2 Sorcery Points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the [Sorcerer Features table](/free-rules/character-classes#SorcererFeatures). You can’t have more Sorcery Points than the number shown in the table for your level. You regain all expended Sorcery Points when you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

You can use your Sorcery Points to fuel the options below, along with other features, such as Metamagic, that use those points.

**_Converting Spell Slots to Sorcery Points._** You can expend a spell slot to gain a number of Sorcery Points equal to the slot’s level (no action required).

**_Creating Spell Slots._** As a Bonus Action, you can transform unexpended Sorcery Points into one spell slot. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level, and it lists the minimum Sorcerer level you must be to create a slot. You can create a spell slot no higher than level 5.

Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

##### Creating Spell Slots {#CreatingSpellSlots}

| Spell Slot Level | Sorcery Point Cost | Min. Sorcerer Level |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| 1                | 2                  | 2                   |
| 2                | 3                  | 3                   |
| 3                | 5                  | 5                   |
| 4                | 6                  | 7                   |
| 5                | 7                  | 9                   |

#### Level 2: Metamagic {#Level2Metamagic}

Because your magic flows from within, you can alter your spells to suit your needs; you gain two Metamagic options of your choice from “[Metamagic Options](/free-rules/character-classes#MetamagicOptions)” later in this class’s description. You use the chosen options to temporarily modify spells you cast. To use an option, you must spend the number of Sorcery Points that it costs.

You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it unless otherwise noted in one of those options.

Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your Metamagic options with one you don’t know. You gain two more options at Sorcerer level 10 and two more at Sorcerer level 17.

#### Level 3: Sorcerer Subclass {#Level3SorcererSubclass}

You gain a Sorcerer subclass of your choice. The [Draconic Sorcery](/free-rules/character-classes#DraconicSorcery) subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Sorcerer levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Sorcerer level or lower.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement {#Level4SorcererAbilityScoreImprovement}

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](/free-rules/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Sorcerer levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Sorcerous Restoration {#Level5SorcerousRestoration}

When you finish a [Short Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), you can regain expended Sorcery Points, but no more than a number equal to half your Sorcerer level (round down). Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### Level 7: Sorcery Incarnate {#Level7SorceryIncarnate}

If you have no uses of Innate Sorcery left, you can use it if you spend 2 Sorcery Points when you take the Bonus Action to activate it.

In addition, while your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can use up to two of your [Metamagic options](/free-rules/character-classes#MetamagicOptions) on each spell you cast.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon {#Level19SorcererEpicBoon}

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](/free-rules/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Dimensional Travel](/free-rules/feats#BoonofDimensionalTravel) is recommended.

#### Level 20: Arcane Apotheosis {#Level20ArcaneApotheosis}

#### Metamagic Options {#MetamagicOptions}

The following options are available to your [Metamagic feature](/free-rules/character-classes#Level2Metamagic). The options are presented in alphabetical order.

##### Careful Spell {#CarefulSpell}

_Cost: 1 Sorcery Point_

When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to double its duration to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

##### Quickened Spell {#QuickenedSpell}

_Cost: 2 Sorcery Points_

When you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to change the casting time to a Bonus Action for this casting.

### Sorcerer Subclasses {#SorcererSubclasses}

A Sorcerer subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Sorcerer levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the [Draconic Sorcery](/free-rules/character-classes#DraconicSorcery) subclass.

#### Draconic Sorcery {#DraconicSorcery}

_Breathe the Magic of Dragons_

Your innate magic comes from the gift of a dragon. Perhaps an ancient dragon facing death bequeathed some of its magical power to you or your ancestor. You might have absorbed magic from a site infused with dragons’ power. Or perhaps you handled a treasure taken from a dragon’s hoard that was steeped in draconic power. Or you might have a dragon for an ancestor.

##### Level 3: Draconic Resilience {#Level3DraconicResilience}

The magic in your body manifests physical traits of your draconic gift. Your Hit Point maximum increases by 3, and it increases by 1 whenever you gain another Sorcerer level.

Parts of you are also covered by dragon-like scales. While you aren’t wearing armor, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Charisma modifiers.

##### Level 3: Draconic Spells {#Level3DraconicSpells}

When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the Draconic Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Draconic Spells {#DraconicSpells}

| Sorcerer Level | Spells                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

##### Level 6: Elemental Affinity {#Level6ElementalAffinity}

Your draconic magic has an affinity with a damage type associated with dragons. Choose one of those types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Poison.

You have Resistance to that damage type, and when you cast a spell that deals damage of that type, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell.

##### Level 14: Dragon Wings {#Level14DragonWings}

As a Bonus Action, you can cause draconic wings to appear on your back. The wings last for 1 hour or until you dismiss them (no action required). For the duration, you have a Fly Speed of 60 feet.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you spend 3 Sorcery Points (no action required) to restore your use of it.

##### Level 18: Dragon Companion {#Level18DragonCompanion}

You can cast [Summon Dragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618843-summon-dragon) without a Material component. You can also cast it once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

Whenever you start casting the spell, you can modify it so that it doesn’t require [Concentration](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration). If you do so, the spell’s duration becomes 1 minute for that casting.

Warlocks quest for knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. They often begin their search for magical power by delving into tomes of forbidden lore, dabbling in invocations meant to attract the power of extraplanar beings, or seeking places of power where the influence of these beings can be felt. In no time, each Warlock is drawn into a binding pact with a powerful patron. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as angels, archfey, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, Warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.

Warlocks view their patrons as resources, as means to the end of achieving magical power. Some Warlocks respect, revere, or even love their patrons; some serve their patrons grudgingly; and some seek to undermine their patrons even as they wield the power their patrons have given them.

Once a pact is made, a Warlock’s thirst for knowledge and power can’t be slaked with mere study. Most Warlocks spend their days pursuing greater power and deeper knowledge, which typically means some kind of adventure.

#### Level 1: Eldritch Invocations {#Level1EldritchInvocations}

You have unearthed Eldritch Invocations, pieces of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability or other lessons. You gain one invocation of your choice, such as [Pact of the Tome](/free-rules/character-classes#PactoftheTome). Invocations are described in the “[Eldritch Invocation Options](/free-rules/character-classes#EldritchInvocationOptions)” section later in this class’s description.

**_Prerequisites._** If an invocation has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn that invocation. For example, if an invocation requires you to be a level 5+ Warlock, you can select the invocation once you reach Warlock level 5.

**_Replacing and Gaining Invocations._** Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your invocations with another one for which you qualify. You can’t replace an invocation if it’s a prerequisite for another invocation that you have.

When you gain certain Warlock levels, you gain more invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations column of the [Warlock Features table](/free-rules/character-classes#WarlockFeatures).

You can’t pick the same invocation more than once unless its description says otherwise.

#### Level 1: Pact Magic {#Level1PactMagic}

Through occult ceremony, you have formed a pact with a mysterious entity to gain magical powers. The entity is a voice in the shadows—its identity unclear—but its boon to you is concrete: the ability to cast spells. See [chapter 7](/free-rules/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Warlock spells, which appear in the [Warlock spell list](/free-rules/character-classes#WarlockSpellList) later in the class’s description.

**_Cantrips._** You know two Warlock cantrips of your choice. [Eldritch Blast](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619161-eldritch-blast) and [Prestidigitation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618893-prestidigitation) are recommended. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Warlock cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the [Warlock Features table](/free-rules/character-classes#WarlockFeatures).

**_Spell Slots._** The Warlock Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock spells of levels 1–5. The table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a [Short](/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

For example, when you’re a level 5 Warlock, you have two level 3 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell [Witch Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619215-witch-bolt), you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a level 3 spell.

**_Prepared Spells of Level 1+._** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Warlock spells. [Charm Person](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618964-charm-person) and [Hex](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618988-hex) are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the [Warlock Features table](/free-rules/character-classes#WarlockFeatures). Whenever that number increases, choose additional Warlock spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new Warlock spell, which can be of levels 1–3.

If another Warlock feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Warlock spells for you.

**_Changing Your Prepared Spells._** Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Warlock spell of an eligible level.

**_Spellcasting Ability._** Charisma is the spellcasting ability for your Warlock spells.

**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use an [Arcane Focus](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/544-arcane-focus) as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells.

#### Level 2: Magical Cunning {#Level2MagicalCunning}

You can perform an esoteric rite for 1 minute. At the end of it, you regain expended Pact Magic spell slots but no more than a number equal to half your maximum (round up). Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### Level 3: Warlock Subclass {#Level3WarlockSubclass}

You gain a Warlock subclass of your choice. The [Fiend Patron](/free-rules/character-classes#FiendPatron) subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Warlock levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Warlock level or lower.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement {#Level4WarlockAbilityScoreImprovement}

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](/free-rules/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Warlock levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 9: Contact Patron {#Level9ContactPatron}

In the past, you usually contacted your patron through intermediaries. Now you can communicate directly; you always have the [Contact Other Plane](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619052-contact-other-plane) spell prepared. With this feature, you can cast the spell without expending a spell slot to contact your patron, and you automatically succeed on the spell’s saving throw.

Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can’t do so in this way again until you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### Level 11: Mystic Arcanum {#Level11MysticArcanum}

Your patron grants you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one level 6 Warlock spell as this arcanum.

You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) before you can cast it in this way again.

As shown in the [Warlock Features table](/free-rules/character-classes#WarlockFeatures), you gain another Warlock spell of your choice that can be cast in this way when you reach Warlock levels 13 (level 7 spell), 15 (level 8 spell), and 17 (level 9 spell).

Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your arcanum spells with another Warlock spell of the same level.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon {#Level19WarlockEpicBoon}

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](/free-rules/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Fate](/free-rules/feats#BoonofFate) is recommended.

#### Level 20: Eldritch Master {#Level20EldritchMaster}

When you use your Magical Cunning feature, you regain all your expended Pact Magic spell slots.

_Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock_

You can cast [False Life](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618866-false-life) on yourself without expending a spell slot. When you cast the spell with this feature, you don’t roll the die for the [Temporary Hit Points](/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints); you automatically get the highest number on the die.

#### Gaze of Two Minds {#GazeofTwoMinds}

_Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock_

You can use a Bonus Action to touch a willing creature and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can take a Bonus Action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. The connection ends if you don’t maintain it in this way.

While perceiving through the other creature’s senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you can cast spells as if you were in your space or the other creature’s space if the two of you are within 60 feet of each other.

#### Gift of the Depths {#GiftoftheDepths}

_Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock_

You can breathe underwater, and you gain a Swim Speed equal to your Speed.

You can also cast [Water Breathing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619205-water-breathing) once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast it in this way again when you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

_Prerequisite: Level 9+ Warlock, [Pact of the Tome](/free-rules/character-classes#PactoftheTome) Invocation_

A new page appears in your *Book of Shadows* when you conjure it. With your permission, a creature can take an action to write its name on that page, which can contain a number of names equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one name).

When any creature whose name is on the page is reduced to 0 Hit Points but not killed outright, the creature magically drops to 1 Hit Point instead. Once this magic is triggered, no creature can benefit from it until you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

As a [Magic](/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action, you can erase a name on the page by touching it.

#### Investment of the Chain Master {#InvestmentoftheChainMaster}

_Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock, [Pact of the Chain](/free-rules/character-classes#PactoftheChain) Invocation_

When you cast [Find Familiar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618877-find-familiar), you infuse the summoned familiar with a measure of your eldritch power, granting the creature the following benefits.

**_Aerial or Aquatic._** The familiar gains either a Fly Speed or a Swim Speed (your choice) of 40 feet.

**_Quick Attack._** As a Bonus Action, you can command the familiar to take the [Attack](/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action.

**_Necrotic or Radiant Damage._** Whenever the familiar deals Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage, you can make it deal Necrotic or Radiant damage instead.

**_Your Save DC._** If the familiar forces a creature to make a saving throw, it uses your spell save DC.

**_Resistance._** When the familiar takes damage, you can take a Reaction to grant it Resistance against that damage.

#### Lessons of the First Ones {#LessonsoftheFirstOnes}

_Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock_

You have received knowledge from an elder entity of the multiverse, allowing you to gain one Origin feat of your choice (see [chapter 5](/free-rules/feats#OriginFeats)).

Once per turn when you hit a creature with your pact weapon, you can deal an extra 1d6 Necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant damage (your choice) to the creature, and you can expend one of your Hit Point Dice to roll it and regain a number of Hit Points equal to the roll plus your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 Hit Point).

#### Mask of Many Faces {#MaskofManyFaces}

#### Otherworldly Leap {#OtherworldlyLeap}

_Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock_

You can cast [Jump](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618991-jump) on yourself without expending a spell slot.

#### Pact of the Blade {#PactoftheBlade}

As a Bonus Action, you can conjure a pact weapon in your hand—a Simple or Martial Melee weapon of your choice with which you bond—or create a bond with a magic weapon you touch; you can’t bond with a magic weapon if someone else is attuned to it or another Warlock is bonded with it. Until the bond ends, you have proficiency with the weapon, and you can use it as a Spellcasting Focus.

Whenever you attack with the bonded weapon, you can use your Charisma modifier for the attack and damage rolls instead of using Strength or Dexterity; and you can cause the weapon to deal Necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant damage or its normal damage type.

Your bond with the weapon ends if you use this feature’s Bonus Action again, if the weapon is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more, or if you die. A conjured weapon disappears when the bond ends.

#### Pact of the Chain {#PactoftheChain}

You learn the [Find Familiar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618877-find-familiar) spell and can cast it as a [Magic](/free-rules/rules-glossary#MagicAction) action without expending a spell slot.

When you cast the spell, you choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: [Imp](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775825-imp), [Pseudodragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775834-pseudodragon), [Quasit](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775835-quasit), [Skeleton](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775841-skeleton), [Slaad Tadpole](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775842-slaad-tadpole), [Sphinx of Wonder](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775843-sphinx-of-wonder), [Sprite](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775845-sprite), or [Venomous Snake](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/4775847-venomous-snake) (see [appendix B](/free-rules/creature-stat-blocks/) for the familiar’s stat block).

Additionally, when you take the [Attack](/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its Reaction.

#### Pact of the Tome {#PactoftheTome}

Stitching together strands of shadow, you conjure forth a book in your hand at the end of a [Short](/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). This *Book of Shadows* (you determine its appearance) contains eldritch magic that only you can access, granting you the benefits below. The book disappears if you conjure another book with this feature or if you die.

**_Cantrips and Rituals._** When the book appears, choose three cantrips, and choose two level 1 spells that have the Ritual tag. The spells can be from any class’s spell list, and they must be spells you don’t already have prepared. While the book is on your person, you have the chosen spells prepared, and they function as Warlock spells for you.

**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use the book as a Spellcasting Focus.

#### Repelling Blast {#RepellingBlast}

_Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock, a Warlock Cantrip That Deals Damage via an Attack Roll_

Choose one of your known Warlock cantrips that requires an attack roll. When you hit a Large or smaller creature with that cantrip, you can push the creature up to 10 feet straight away from you.

**_Repeatable._** You can gain this invocation more than once. Each time you do so, choose a different eligible cantrip.

#### Thirsting Blade {#ThirstingBlade}

_Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock, [Pact of the Blade](/free-rules/character-classes#PactoftheBlade) Invocation_

You gain the Extra Attack feature for your pact weapon only. With that feature, you can attack twice with the weapon instead of once when you take the [Attack](/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) action on your turn.

#### Visions of Distant Realms {#VisionsofDistantRealms}

_Prerequisite: Level 9+ Warlock_

You can cast [Arcane Eye](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618863-arcane-eye) without expending a spell slot.

#### Witch Sight {#WitchSight}

_Prerequisite: Level 15+ Warlock_

You have [Truesight](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Truesight) with a range of 30 feet.

### Warlock Spell List {#WarlockSpellList}

This section presents the Warlock spell list. The spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell’s school of magic is listed. In the Special column, *C* means the spell requires Concentration, *R* means it’s a Ritual, and *M* means it requires a specific Material component.

### Warlock Subclass {#WarlockSubclass}

A Warlock subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Warlock levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the [Fiend Patron](/free-rules/character-classes#FiendPatron) subclass.

#### Fiend Patron {#FiendPatron}

_Make a Deal with the Lower Planes_

Your pact draws on the Lower Planes, the realms of perdition. You might forge a bargain with a demon lord such as Demogorgon or Orcus; an archdevil such as Asmodeus; or a pit fiend, balor, yugoloth, or night hag that is especially mighty. That patron’s aims are evil—the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you—and your path is defined by the extent to which you strive against those aims.

##### Level 3: Dark One’s Blessing {#Level3DarkOnesBlessing}

When you reduce an enemy to 0 Hit Points, you gain [Temporary Hit Points](/free-rules/rules-glossary#TemporaryHitPoints) equal to your Charisma modifier plus your Warlock level (minimum of 1 Temporary Hit Point). You also gain this benefit if someone else reduces an enemy within 10 feet of you to 0 Hit Points.

##### Level 3: Fiend Spells {#Level3FiendSpells}

The magic of your patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Fiend Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Level 6: Dark One’s Own Luck {#Level6DarkOnesOwnLuck}

You can call on your fiendish patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add 1d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the roll but before any of the roll’s effects occur.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), but you can use it no more than once per roll. You regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

##### Level 10: Fiendish Resilience {#Level10FiendishResilience}

Choose one damage type, other than Force, whenever you finish a [Short](/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). You have Resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature.

##### Level 14: Hurl Through Hell {#Level14HurlThroughHell}

Once per turn when you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can try to instantly transport the target through the Lower Planes. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC, or the target disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape. The target takes 8d10 Psychic damage if it isn’t a Fiend, and it has the [Incapacitated](/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition until the end of your next turn, when it returns to the space it previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest) unless you expend a Pact Magic spell slot (no action required) to restore your use of it.

Wizards are defined by their exhaustive study of magic’s inner workings. They cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and spectacular transformations. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or forms protective barriers. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.

Most Wizards share a scholarly approach to magic. They examine the theoretical underpinnings of magic, particularly the categorization of spells into schools of magic. Renowned Wizards such as Bigby, Tasha, Mordenkainen, and Yolande have built on their studies to invent iconic spells now used across the multiverse.

The closest a Wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer. Other Wizards sell their services as advisers, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.

But the lure of knowledge calls even the most unadventurous Wizards from the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most Wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.

#### Level 1: Spellcasting {#Level1WizardSpellcasting}

As a student of arcane magic, you have learned to cast spells. See [chapter 7](/free-rules/spells/) for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Wizard spells, which appear in the Wizard spell list later in the class’s description.

**_Cantrips._** You know three Wizard cantrips of your choice. [Light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618996-light), [Mage Hand](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619008-mage-hand), and [Ray of Frost](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618930-ray-of-frost) are recommended. Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Wizard cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Wizard levels 4 and 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the [Wizard Features table](/free-rules/character-classes#WizardFeatures).

**_Spellbook._** Your wizardly apprenticeship culminated in the creation of a unique book: your spellbook. It is a Tiny object that weighs 3 pounds, contains 100 pages, and can be read only by you or someone casting [Identify](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619180-identify). You determine the book’s appearance and materials, such as a gilt-edged tome or a collection of vellum bound with twine.

The book contains the level 1+ spells you know. It starts with six level 1 Wizard spells of your choice. [Detect Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619097-detect-magic), [Feather Fall](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618874-feather-fall), [Mage Armor](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619006-mage-armor), [Magic Missile](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619022-magic-missile), [Sleep](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619064-sleep), and [Thunderwave](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619184-thunderwave) are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Wizard level after 1, add two Wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown in the [Wizard Features table](/free-rules/character-classes#WizardFeatures). The spells are the culmination of arcane research you do regularly.

**_Spell Slots._** The Wizard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

**_Prepared Spells of Level 1+._** You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To do so, choose four spells from your spellbook. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Wizard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the [Wizard Features table](/free-rules/character-classes#WizardFeatures). Whenever that number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Wizard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination, chosen from your spellbook.

If another Wizard feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Wizard spells for you.

**_Changing Your Prepared Spells._** Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with spells from your spellbook.

**_Spellcasting Ability._** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.

**_Spellcasting Focus._** You can use an [Arcane Focus](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/544-arcane-focus) or your [spellbook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/86-spellbook) as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.

Expanding and Replacing a Spellbook

The spells you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect your ongoing magical research, but you might find other spells during your adventures that you can add to the book. You could discover a Wizard spell on a [Spell Scroll](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/9229085-spell-scroll), for example, and then copy it into your spellbook.

**_Copying a Spell into the Book._** When you find a level 1+ Wizard spell, you can copy it into your spellbook if it’s of a level you can prepare and if you have time to copy it. For each level of the spell, the transcription takes 2 hours and costs 50 GP. Afterward you can prepare the spell like the other spells in your spellbook.

**_Copying the Book._** You can copy a spell from your spellbook into another book. This is like copying a new spell into your spellbook but faster, since you already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 GP for each level of the copied spell.

If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the Wizard spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of the new book requires you to find new spells to do so. For this reason, many wizards keep a backup spellbook.

#### Level 1: Ritual Adept {#Level1RitualAdept}

You can cast any spell as a Ritual if that spell has the Ritual tag and the spell is in your spellbook. You needn’t have the spell prepared, but you must read from the book to cast a spell in this way.

#### Level 1: Arcane Recovery {#Level1ArcaneRecovery}

You can regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. When you finish a [Short Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level equal to no more than half your Wizard level (round up), and none of the slots can be level 6 or higher. For example, if you’re a level 4 Wizard, you can recover up to two levels’ worth of spell slots, regaining either one level 2 spell slot or two level 1 spell slots.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest).

#### Level 2: Scholar {#Level2Scholar}

While studying magic, you also specialized in another field of study. Choose one of the following skills in which you have proficiency: [Arcana](/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [History](/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Investigation](/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Medicine](/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), [Nature](/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills), or [Religion](/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills). You have [Expertise](/free-rules/rules-glossary#Expertise) in the chosen skill.

#### Level 3: Wizard Subclass {#Level3WizardSubclass}

You gain a Wizard subclass of your choice. The [Evoker](/free-rules/character-classes#Evoker) subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Wizard levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Wizard level or lower.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement {#Level4WizardAbilityScoreImprovement}

You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see [chapter 5](/free-rules/feats#AbilityScoreImprovement)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Wizard levels 8, 12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Memorize Spell {#Level5MemorizeSpell}

Whenever you finish a [Short Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest), you can study your spellbook and replace one of the level 1+ Wizard spells you have prepared for your Spellcasting feature with another level 1+ spell from the book.

#### Level 18: Spell Mastery {#Level18SpellMastery}

You have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a level 1 and a level 2 spell in your spellbook that have a casting time of an action. You always have those spells prepared, and you can cast them at their lowest level without expending a spell slot. To cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot.

Whenever you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you can study your spellbook and replace one of those spells with an eligible spell of the same level from the book.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon {#Level19WizardEpicBoon}

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see [chapter 5](/free-rules/feats#EpicBoonFeats)) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. [Boon of Spell Recall](/free-rules/feats#BoonofSpellRecall) is recommended.

#### Level 20: Signature Spells {#Level20SignatureSpells}

Choose two level 3 spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, and you can cast each of them once at level 3 without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t cast them in this way again until you finish a [Short](/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest) or [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest). To cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot.

### Wizard Spell List {#WizardSpellList}

This section presents the Wizard spell list. The spells are organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell’s school of magic is listed. In the Special column, *C* means the spell requires Concentration, *R* means it’s a Ritual, and *M* means it requires a specific Material component.

### Wizard Subclass {#WizardSubclass}

A Wizard subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Wizard levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the [Evoker](/free-rules/character-classes#Evoker) subclass.

#### Evoker {#Evoker}

_Create Explosive Elemental Effects_

Your studies focus on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some Evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast armies from afar. Others use their power to protect others, while some seek their own gain.

##### Level 3: Evocation Savant {#Level3EvocationSavant}

Choose two Wizard spells from the Evocation school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free.

In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wizard spell from the Evocation school to your spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

##### Level 3: Potent Cantrip {#Level3PotentCantrip}

Your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When you cast a cantrip at a creature and you miss with the attack roll or the target succeeds on a saving throw against the cantrip, the target takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.

##### Level 6: Sculpt Spells {#Level6SculptSpells}

You can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocations. When you cast an Evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 plus the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.

##### Level 10: Empowered Evocation {#Level10EmpoweredEvocation}

Whenever you cast a Wizard spell from the Evocation school, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of that spell.

##### Level 14: Overchannel {#Level14Overchannel}

You can increase the power of your spells. When you cast a Wizard spell with a spell slot of levels 1–5 that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell on the turn you cast it.

The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a [Long Rest](/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest), you take 2d12 Necrotic damage for each level of the spell slot immediately after you cast it. This damage ignores Resistance and Immunity.

Each time you use this feature again before finishing a Long Rest, the Necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12.
