Magic items are presented in alphabetical order.

If a magic item description capitalizes a creature’s name and presents it in bold type, that’s a visual cue pointing you to the creature’s stat block. Unless the text states otherwise, the stat block is in the Monster Manual. How to read and use a [stat block](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StatBlock) is explained in the Monster Manual and to a lesser degree in the [rules glossary](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules).
