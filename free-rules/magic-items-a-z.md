# Magic Items A-Z

Magic items are presented in alphabetical order.

If a magic item description capitalizes a creature’s name and presents it in bold type, that’s a visual cue pointing you to the creature’s stat block. Unless the text states otherwise, the stat block is in the Monster Manual. How to read and use a [stat block](/free-rules/rules-glossary#StatBlock) is explained in the Monster Manual and to a lesser degree in the [rules glossary](/free-rules).
