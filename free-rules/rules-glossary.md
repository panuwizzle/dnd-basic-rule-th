# Rules Glossary

## [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#GlossaryConventions)Glossary Conventions

The glossary uses the following conventions:

**Tags in Brackets.** Some entries have a tag in brackets after the entry’s name, as in “Attack [Action].” A tag—[Action](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Action), [Area of Effect](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AreaofEffect), [Attitude](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Attitude), [Condition](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Condition), or [Hazard](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Hazard)—indicates that a rule is part of a family of rules. The tags also have glossary entries.

**“You.”** The game’s rules—in this glossary and elsewhere—often talk about something happening to you in the game world. That “you” refers to the creature or object that the rule applies to in a particular moment of play. For example, the “you” in the [Prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition is a creature that currently has that condition.

**“See Also.”** Some glossary entries include a _See also_ section that points to other entries in the glossary, to chapters in this book, or both.

**No Obsolete Terms.** The glossary contains definitions of current rules terms only. If you’re looking for a term from an earlier version of the fifth edition rules, consult the index.

**Abbreviations.** The abbreviations listed below appear in this glossary and elsewhere in the rules.

## [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RulesDefinitions)Rules Definitions

Here are definitions of various rules.

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AbilityCheck)Ability Check

An ability check is a [D20 Test](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#D20Test) that represents using one of the six abilities—or a specific skill associated with an ability—to overcome a challenge. _See also_ chapter 1 (“[D20 Tests](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#D20Tests)” and “[Proficiency](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Proficiency)”).

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AbilityScoreandModifier)Ability Score and Modifier

A creature has six ability scores—Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma—each of which has a corresponding modifier. Add the modifier when you make a [D20 Test](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#D20Test) with the corresponding ability or when a rule asks you to do so. _See also_ chapter 1 (“[The Six Abilities](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#TheSixAbilities)”).

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Action)Action

On your turn, you can take one action. Choose which action to take from those below or from the special actions provided by your features. _See also_ chapter 1 (“[Actions](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Actions)”). These actions are defined elsewhere in this glossary:

[Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction)

[Dash](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DashAction)

[Disengage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DisengageAction)

[Dodge](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DodgeAction)

[Help](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#HelpAction)

[Hide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#HideAction)

[Search](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#SearchAction)

[Study](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StudyAction)

[Utilize](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UtilizeAction)

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage)Advantage

If you have Advantage on a [D20 Test](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#D20Test), roll two d20s, and use the higher roll. A roll can’t be affected by more than one Advantage, and Advantage and [Disadvantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on the same roll cancel each other. _See also_ chapter 1 (“[D20 Tests](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#AdvantageDisadvantage)”).

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Adventure)Adventure

An adventure is a series of encounters. A story emerges through playing them. _See also_ “[Encounter](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Encounter).”

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Alignment)Alignment

A creature’s alignment broadly describes its ethical attitudes and ideals. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). These factors allow for nine possible combinations, such as Lawful Good and Neutral Evil. _See also_ chapter 2 (“[Create Your Character](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/creating-a-character#Step4ChooseanAlignment)”).

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Ally)Ally

A creature is your ally if it is a member of your adventuring party, your friend, on your side in combat, or a creature that the rules or the DM designates as your ally.

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AreaofEffect)Area of Effect

The descriptions of many spells and other features specify that they have an area of effect, which typically has one of six shapes. These shapes are defined elsewhere in this glossary:

[Cone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ConeAreaofEffect)

[Cube](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CubeAreaofEffect)

[Cylinder](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CylinderAreaofEffect)

[Emanation](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#EmanationAreaofEffect)

[Line](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LineAreaofEffect)

[Sphere](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#SphereAreaofEffect)

An area of effect has a point of origin, a location from which the effect’s energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how to position its point of origin. If all straight lines extending from the point of origin to a location in the area of effect are blocked, that location isn’t included in the area of effect. To block a line, an obstruction must provide [Total Cover](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover). _See also_ “[Cover](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover).”

If the creator of an area of effect places it at an unseen point and an obstruction—such as a wall—is between the creator and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of the obstruction.

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ArmorClass)Armor Class

An Armor Class (AC) is the target number for an attack roll. AC represents how difficult it is to hit a target.

Your base AC calculation is 10 plus your Dexterity modifier. If a rule gives you another base AC calculation, you choose which calculation to use; you can’t use more than one. _See also_ “[Attack Roll](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackRoll).”

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ArmorTraining)Armor Training

Armor training allows you to use armor of a certain category without the following drawbacks. If you wear Light, Medium, or Heavy armor and lack training with it, you have Disadvantage on any [D20 Test](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#D20Test) that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t cast spells. If you use a Shield and lack training with it, you don’t gain its AC bonus. _See also_ “[Disadvantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage)” and chapter 6 (“[Armor](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Armor)”).

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction)Attack [Action]

When you take the Attack action, you can make one attack roll with a weapon or an [Unarmed Strike](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike).

**_Equipping and Unequipping Weapons._** You can either equip or unequip one weapon when you make an attack as part of this action. You do so either before or after the attack. If you equip a weapon before an attack, you don’t need to use it for that attack. Equipping a weapon includes drawing it from a sheath or picking it up. Unequipping a weapon includes sheathing, stowing, or dropping it.

**_Moving between Attacks._** If you move on your turn and have a feature, such as Extra Attack, that gives you more than one attack as part of the Attack action, you can use some or all of that movement to move between those attacks.

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackRoll)Attack Roll

An attack roll is a [D20 Test](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#D20Test) that represents making an attack with a weapon, an [Unarmed Strike](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike), or a spell. _See also_ chapter 1 (“[D20 Tests](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#AttackRolls)”).

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Attitude)Attitude

A monster has a starting attitude toward a player character: Friendly, Hostile, or Indifferent. _See also_ “[Friendly](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FriendlyAttitude),” “[Hostile](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#HostileAttitude),” “[Indifferent](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IndifferentAttitude),” and “[Influence](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InfluenceAction).”

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Attunement)Attunement

Some magic items require a creature to form a bond—called Attunement—with them before the creature can use an item’s magical properties. A creature can have Attunement with no more than three magic items at a time. _See also_ chapter 6 (“[Magic Items](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Attunement)”).

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition)Blinded [Condition]

While you have the Blinded condition, you experience the following effects.

**_Can’t See._** You can’t see and automatically fail any ability check that requires sight.

**_Attacks Affected._** Attack rolls against you have [Advantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage), and your attack rolls have [Disadvantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage).

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#senseBlindsightsense)Blindsight

If you have Blindsight, you can see within a specific range without relying on physical sight. Within that range, you can see anything that isn’t behind [Total Cover](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#Cover) even if you have the [Blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition) condition or are in [Darkness](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Darkness). Moreover, in that range, you can see something that has the [Invisible](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) condition.

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Bloodied)Bloodied

A creature is Bloodied while it has half its [Hit Points](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#HitPoints) or fewer remaining.

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BonusAction)Bonus Action

A Bonus Action is a special action that you can take on the same turn that you take an action. You can’t take more than one Bonus Action on a turn, and you have a Bonus Action to take only if a rule explicitly says so. _See also_ chapter 1 (“[Actions](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#BonusActions)”).

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BreakingObjects)Breaking Objects

Objects can be harmed by attacks and by some spells, using the rules below. If an object is exceedingly fragile, the DM may allow a creature to break it automatically with the [Attack](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackAction) or [Utilize](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UtilizeAction) action.

**_Armor Class._** The Object Armor Class table suggests ACs for various substances.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ObjectArmorClass)Object Armor Class
|AC|Substance|
|---|---|
|11|Cloth, paper, rope|
|13|Crystal, glass, ice|
|15|Wood|
|17|Stone|
|19|Iron, steel|
|21|Mithral|
|23|Adamantine|

**_Hit Points._** An object is destroyed when it has 0 [Hit Points](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#HitPoints). The Object Hit Points table suggests Hit Points for fragile and resilient objects that are Large or smaller. To track Hit Points for a Huge or Gargantuan object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each section’s Hit Points separately. The DM determines whether destroying part of an object causes the whole thing to collapse.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ObjectHitPoints)Object Hit Points
|Size|Fragile|Resilient|
|---|---|---|
|Tiny (bottle, lock)|2 (1d4)|5 (2d4)|
|Small (chest, lute)|3 (1d6)|10 (3d6)|
|Medium (barrel, chandelier)|4 (1d8)|18 (4d8)|
|Large (cart, dining table)|5 (1d10)|27 (5d10)|

**_Damage Types and Objects._** Objects have [Immunity](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Immunity) to Poison and Psychic damage. The DM might decide that some damage types are more or less effective against an object. For example, Bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting. Paper or cloth objects might have Vulnerability to Fire damage.

**_Damage Threshold._** Big objects, such as castle walls, often have extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. _See also_ “[Damage Threshold](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DamageThreshold).”

**_No Ability Scores._** An object lacks ability scores unless a rule assigns scores to the object. Without ability scores, an object can’t make ability checks, and it fails all saving throws.

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BrightLight)Bright Light

Bright Light is normal illumination. _See also_ chapter 1 (“[Exploration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Light)”).

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BurningHazard)Burning [Hazard]

A burning creature or object takes 1d4 Fire damage at the start of each of its turns. As an action, you can extinguish fire on yourself by giving yourself the [Prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition and rolling on the ground. The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or suffocated.

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BurrowSpeed)Burrow Speed

A creature that has a Burrow Speed can use that speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. The creature can’t burrow through solid rock unless the creature has a trait that allows it to do so. _See also_ “[Speed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Speed).”

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Campaign)Campaign

A campaign is a series of adventures. _See also_ “[Adventure](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Adventure).”

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cantrip)Cantrip

A cantrip is a level 0 spell, which is cast without a spell slot. _See also_ [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/spells/).

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CarryingCapacity)Carrying Capacity

Your size and Strength score determine the maximum weight in pounds that you can carry, as shown in the Carrying Capacity table. The table also shows the maximum weight you can drag, lift, or push.

While dragging, lifting, or pushing weight in excess of the maximum weight you can carry, your [Speed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Speed) can be no more than 5 feet.

#### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CarryingCapacityTable)Carrying Capacity
|Creature Size|Carry|Drag/Lift/Push|
|---|---|---|
|Tiny|Str. × 7.5 lb.|Str. × 15 lb.|
|Small/Medium|Str. × 15 lb.|Str. × 30 lb.|
|Large|Str. × 30 lb.|Str. × 60 lb.|
|Huge|Str. × 60 lb.|Str. × 120 lb.|
|Gargantuan|Str. × 120 lb.|Str. × 240 lb.|

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ChallengeRating)Challenge Rating

Challenge Rating (CR) summarizes the threat a monster poses to a group of four player characters. Compare a monster’s CR to the characters’ level. If the CR is higher, the monster is likely a danger. If the CR is lower, the monster likely poses little threat. But circumstances and the number of player characters can significantly alter how threatening a monster is in actual play. The _Dungeon Master’s Guide_ provides guidance to the DM on using CR while planning potential combat encounters. _See also_ “[Stat Block](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StatBlock).”

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharacterSheet)Character Sheet

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition)Charmed [Condition]

While you have the Charmed condition, you experience the following effects.

**_Can’t Harm the Charmer._** You can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer with damaging abilities or magical effects.

**_Social Advantage._** The charmer has [Advantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on any ability check to interact with you socially.

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Climbing)Climbing

While you’re climbing, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in [Difficult Terrain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DifficultTerrain)). You ignore this extra cost if you have a [Climb Speed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ClimbSpeed) and use it to climb.

At the DM’s option, climbing a slippery surface or one with few handholds might require a successful DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check.

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ClimbSpeed)Climb Speed

A Climb Speed can be used in place of Speed to traverse a vertical surface without expending the extra movement normally associated with climbing. _See also_ “[Climbing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Climbing)” and “[Speed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Speed).”

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration)Concentration

Some spells and other effects require Concentration to remain active, as specified in their descriptions. If the effect’s creator loses Concentration, the effect ends. If the effect has a maximum duration, the effect’s description specifies how long the creator can concentrate on it: up to 1 minute, 1 hour, or some other duration. The creator can end Concentration at any time (no action required). The following factors break Concentration.

**_Another Concentration Effect._** You lose Concentration on an effect the moment you start casting a spell that requires Concentration or activate another effect that requires Concentration.

**_Damage._** If you take damage, you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw to maintain Concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage taken (round down), whichever number is higher, up to a maximum DC of 30.

**_Incapacitated or Dead._** Your Concentration ends if you have the [Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition or you die.

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Condition)Condition

A condition is a temporary game state. The definition of a condition says how it affects its recipient, and various rules define how to end a condition. This glossary defines these conditions:

[Blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition)

[Charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CharmedCondition)

[Deafened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DeafenedCondition)

[Exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition)

[Frightened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FrightenedCondition)

[Grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#GrappledCondition)

[Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition)

[Paralyzed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ParalyzedCondition)

[Petrified](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PetrifiedCondition)

[Poisoned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PoisonedCondition)

[Prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition)

[Restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#RestrainedCondition)

[Stunned](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#StunnedCondition)

[Unconscious](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition)

A condition doesn’t stack with itself; a recipient either has a condition or doesn’t. The Exhaustion condition is an exception to that rule. _See also_ chapter 1 (“[Conditions](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Conditions)”).

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ConeAreaofEffect)Cone [Area of Effect]

A Cone is an [area of effect](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AreaofEffect) that extends in straight lines from a point of origin in a direction its creator chooses. A Cone’s width at any point along its length is equal to that point’s distance from the point of origin. For example, a Cone is 15 feet wide at a point along its length that is 15 feet from the point of origin. The effect that creates a Cone specifies its maximum length.

A Cone’s point of origin isn’t included in the area of effect unless its creator decides otherwise.

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover)Cover

Cover provides a degree of protection to a target behind it. There are three degrees of cover, each of which provides a different benefit to a target: [Half Cover](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover) (+2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws), [Three-Quarters Cover](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover) (+5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws), and [Total Cover](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Cover) (can’t be targeted directly). If behind more than one degree of cover, a target benefits only from the most protective degree. _See also_ chapter 1 (“[Combat](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Cover)”).

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Crawling)Crawling

While you’re crawling, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in [Difficult Terrain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DifficultTerrain)). _See also_ “[Speed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Speed).”

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Creature)Creature

Any being in the game, including a player’s character, is a creature. _See also_ “[Creature Type](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CreatureType).”

Aberration

Beast

Celestial

Construct

Dragon

Elemental

Fey

Fiend

Giant

Humanoid

Monstrosity

Ooze

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CriticalHit)Critical Hit

If you roll a 20 on the d20 for an attack roll, you score a Critical Hit, and the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC. A Critical Hit lets you roll extra dice for the attack’s damage against the target. Roll all of the attack’s damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers. _See also_ chapter 1 (“[Damage and Healing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#CriticalHits)”).

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#CubeAreaofEffect)Cube [Area of Effect]

A Cube is an [area of effect](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AreaofEffect) that extends in straight lines from a point of origin located anywhere on a face of the Cube. The effect that creates a Cube specifies its size, which is the length of each side.

A Cube’s point of origin isn’t included in the area of effect unless its creator decides otherwise.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Curses)Curses

Some game effects curse a creature or an object. The effect that confers a curse defines what the curse does. Curses can be removed by the [Remove Curse](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618943-remove-curse) and [Greater Restoration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618961-greater-restoration) spells or other magic that explicitly ends curses.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#D20Test)D20 Test

D20 Tests encompass the three main d20 rolls of the game: [ability checks](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AbilityCheck), [attack rolls](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackRoll), and [saving throws](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#SavingThrow). If something in the game affects D20 Tests, it affects all three of these rolls. The DM determines whether a D20 Test is warranted in a given circumstance. _See also_ chapter 1 (“[D20 Tests](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#D20Tests)”).

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Damage)Damage

Damage represents harm that causes a creature or an object to lose [Hit Points](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#HitPoints).

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DamageRoll)Damage Roll

A damage roll is a die roll, adjusted by any applicable modifiers, that deals damage to a target. _See also_ chapter 1 (“[Damage and Healing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#DamageRolls)”).

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DamageThreshold)Damage Threshold

A creature or an object that has a damage threshold has [Immunity](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Immunity) to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes that entire instance of damage. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the damage threshold is superficial and doesn’t reduce [Hit Points](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#HitPoints). For example, if an object has a damage threshold of 10, the object takes no damage if 9 damage is dealt to it, since that damage fails to exceed the threshold. If the same object is dealt 11 damage, it takes all of that damage.

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DamageTypes)Damage Types

Attacks and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as [Resistance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Resistance), rely on the types. The Damage Types table offers examples to help a DM assign a type to a new effect.

|Type|Examples|
|---|---|
|Acid|Corrosive liquids, digestive enzymes|

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DashAction)Dash [Action]

When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your Speed after applying any modifiers. With a Speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you Dash. If your Speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you Dash.

If you have a special speed, such as a [Fly Speed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FlySpeed) or [Swim Speed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#SwimSpeed), you can use that speed instead of your Speed when you take this action. You choose which speed to use each time you take it. _See also_ “[Speed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Speed).”

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Dead)Dead

A dead creature has no [Hit Points](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#HitPoints) and can’t regain them unless it is first revived by magic such as the [Raise Dead](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618922-raise-dead) or [Revivify](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618956-revivify) spell. When such a spell is cast, the spirit knows who is casting it and can refuse. The spirit of a dead creature has left the body and departed for the Outer Planes, and reviving the creature requires calling the spirit back.

If the creature returns to life, the revival effect determines the creature’s current Hit Points. Unless otherwise stated, the creature returns to life with any conditions, magical contagions, or curses that were affecting it at death if the durations of those effects are still ongoing. If the creature died with any [Exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition) levels, it returns with 1 fewer level. If the creature had [Attunement](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Attunement) to one or more magic items, it is no longer attuned to them.

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Grappling)Grappling

A creature can grapple another creature. Characters typically grapple by using an Unarmed Strike. Many monsters have special attacks that allow them to quickly grapple prey. However a grapple is initiated, it follows these rules. _See also_ “[Unarmed Strike](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnarmedStrike)” and “[Grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#GrappledCondition).”

**_Grappled Condition._** Successfully grappling a creature gives it the Grappled condition.

**_One Grapple per Hand._** A creature must have a hand free to grapple another creature. Some stat blocks and game effects allow a creature to grapple using a tentacle, a maw, or another body part. Whatever part a grappler uses, it can grapple only one creature at a time with that part, and the grappler can’t use that part to target another creature unless it ends the grapple.

**_Escaping a Grapple._** A Grappled creature can use its action to make a Strength ([Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) or Dexterity ([Acrobatics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check against the grapple’s escape DC, ending the condition on itself on a success. The condition also ends if the grappler has the [Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition or if the distance between the Grappled target and the grappler exceeds the grapple’s range.

On a successful check, you have the [Invisible](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InvisibleCondition) condition. Make note of your check’s total, which is the DC for a creature to find you with a Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check.

The condition ends on you immediately after any of the following occurs: you make a sound louder than a whisper, an enemy finds you, you make an attack roll, or you cast a spell with a Verbal component.

When you make a High Jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 plus your Strength modifier (minimum of 0 feet) if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing High Jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot of the jump costs a foot of movement.

You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1½ times your height.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#HitPoints)Hit Points

Hit Points (HP) are a measure of how difficult it is to kill or destroy a creature or an object. Damage reduces Hit Points, and healing restores them. You can’t have more Hit Points than your Hit Point maximum, and you can’t have less than 0. _See also_ “[Breaking Objects](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BreakingObjects)” and chapter 1 (“[Damage and Healing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#HitPoints)”).

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Illusions)Illusions

Spells and other effects sometimes create magical illusions. Such an effect defines what the illusion does and which senses or mental faculties it deceives.

If an illusion manifests in space, the illusion is insubstantial and weightless, yet it seems to be affected by the environment as if the illusion were real unless the effect that created it specifies otherwise. For example, a visual illusion of a creature casts shadows and reflections, and wind appears to affect the illusory creature. Similarly, an audible illusion echoes in an echoey space.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ImprovisedWeapons)Improvised Weapons

An improvised weapon is an object wielded as a makeshift weapon, such as broken glass, a table leg, or a frying pan. A Simple or Martial weapon also counts as an improvised weapon if it’s wielded in a way contrary to its design; if you use a Ranged weapon to make a melee attack or throw a Melee weapon that lacks the [Thrown](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/equipment#Thrown) property, the weapon counts as an improvised weapon. An improvised weapon follows the rules below.

**_Proficiency._** Don’t add your Proficiency Bonus to attack rolls with an improvised weapon.

**_Damage._** On a hit, the weapon deals 1d4 damage of a type the DM thinks is appropriate for the object.

**_Range._** If you throw the weapon, it has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

**_Weapon Equivalents._** If an improvised weapon resembles a Simple or Martial weapon, the DM may say it functions as that weapon and uses that weapon’s rules. For example, the DM could treat a table leg as a Club.

**_No Concentration._** Your [Concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration) is broken.

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#InfluenceAction)Influence [Action]

With the Influence action, you urge a monster to do something. Describe or roleplay how you’re communicating with the monster. Are you trying to deceive, intimidate, amuse, or gently persuade? The DM then determines whether the monster feels willing, unwilling, or hesitant due to your interaction; this determination establishes whether an ability check is necessary, as explained below.

**_Willing._** If your urging aligns with the monster’s desires, no ability check is necessary; the monster fulfills your request in a way it prefers.

**_Unwilling._** If your urging is repugnant to the monster or counter to its alignment, no ability check is necessary; it doesn’t comply.

**_Hesitant._** If you urge the monster to do something that it is hesitant to do, you must make an ability check, which is affected by the monster’s attitude: [Indifferent](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IndifferentAttitude), [Friendly](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FriendlyAttitude), or [Hostile](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#HostileAttitude), each of which is defined in this glossary. The Influence Checks table suggests which ability check to make based on how you’re interacting with the monster. The DM chooses the check, which has a default DC equal to 15 or the monster’s Intelligence score, whichever is higher. On a successful check, the monster does as urged. On a failed check, you must wait 24 hours (or a duration set by the DM) before urging it in the same way again.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Initiative)Initiative

Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. The combat rules in chapter 1 explain how to roll Initiative.

Sometimes a DM might have combatants use their Initiative scores instead of rolling Initiative. Your Initiative score equals 10 plus your Dexterity modifier. If you have [Advantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on Initiative rolls, increase your Initiative score by 5. If you have [Disadvantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on those rolls, decrease that score by 5. _See also_ chapter 1 (“[Combat](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Combat)”).

**_Concealed._** You aren’t affected by any effect that requires its target to be seen unless the effect’s creator can somehow see you. Any equipment you are wearing or carrying is also concealed.

**_Attacks Affected._** Attack rolls against you have [Disadvantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage), and your attack rolls have Advantage. If a creature can somehow see you, you don’t gain this benefit against that creature.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#KnockingOutaCreature)Knocking Out a Creature

When you would reduce a creature to 0 [Hit Points](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#HitPoints) with a melee attack, you can instead reduce the creature to 1 Hit Point. The creature then has the [Unconscious](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition) condition and starts a [Short Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest).

The creature remains Unconscious until it regains any Hit Points or until someone uses an action to administer first aid to it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom ([Medicine](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongJump)Long Jump

When you make a Long Jump, you leap horizontally a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet immediately before the jump. When you make a standing Long Jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you jump costs a foot of movement.

If you land in [Difficult Terrain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DifficultTerrain), you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check or have the [Prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition.

This Long Jump rule assumes that the height of the jump doesn’t matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your DM’s option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength ([Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump’s distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit the obstacle.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#LongRest)Long Rest

A Long Rest is a period of extended downtime—at least 8 hours—available to any creature. During a Long Rest, you sleep for at least 6 hours and perform no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch.

During sleep, you have the [Unconscious](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#UnconsciousCondition) condition. After you finish a Long Rest, you must wait at least 16 hours before starting another one.

**_Benefits of the Rest._** To start a Long Rest, you must have at least 1 Hit Point. When you finish the rest, you gain the following benefits:

**Regain All HP.** You regain all lost [Hit Points](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#HitPoints) and all spent Hit Point Dice. If your Hit Point maximum was reduced, it returns to normal.

**Ability Scores Restored.** If any of your ability scores were reduced, they return to normal.

**Exhaustion Reduced.** If you have the [Exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ExhaustionCondition) condition, its level decreases by 1.

**Special Feature.** Some features are recharged by a Long Rest. If you have such a feature, it recharges in the way specified in its description.

**_Interrupting the Rest._** A Long Rest is stopped by the following interruptions:

- Rolling [Initiative](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Initiative)
- Casting a spell other than a cantrip
- Taking any damage
- 1 hour of walking or other physical exertion

If you rested at least 1 hour before the interruption, you gain the benefits of a Short Rest. _See also_ “[Short Rest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest).”

You can resume a Long Rest immediately after an interruption. If you do so, the rest requires 1 additional hour per interruption to finish.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#PassivePerception)Passive Perception

Passive Perception is a score that reflects a creature’s general awareness of its surroundings. The DM uses this score when determining whether a creature notices something without consciously making a Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check.

A creature’s Passive Perception equals 10 plus the creature’s Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) check bonus. If the creature has [Advantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Advantage) on such checks, increase the score by 5. If the creature has [Disadvantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on them, decrease the score by 5. For example, a level 1 character with a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception has a Passive Perception of 14 (10 + 2 + 2).

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ReadyAction)Ready [Action]

You take the Ready action to wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you take this action on your turn, which lets you act by taking a [Reaction](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Reaction) before the start of your next turn.

First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your Reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your [Speed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Speed) in response to it. Examples include “If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the lever that opens it,” and “If the zombie steps next to me, I move away.”

When the trigger occurs, you can either take your Reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger.

When you Ready a spell, you cast it as normal (expending any resources used to cast it) but hold its energy, which you release with your Reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of an action, and holding on to the spell’s magic requires [Concentration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Concentration), which you can maintain up to the start of your next turn. If your Concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect.

It also doesn’t expend a spell slot, which means the ritual version of a spell can’t be cast at a higher level. _See also_ [chapter 7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/spells/).

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#SavingThrow)Saving Throw

A saving throw—also called a save—represents an attempt to avoid or resist a threat. You normally make a saving throw only when a rule requires you to do so, but you can decide to fail the save without rolling. The result of a save is detailed in the effect that allowed it. If a target is forced to make a save and lacks the ability score used by it, the target automatically fails. _See also_ chapter 1 (“[D20 Tests](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#SavingThrows)”).

If an effect, such as Wild Shape or the [Polymorph](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618876-polymorph) spell, lets you shape-shift, its description specifies what happens to you. Unless that description says otherwise, any ongoing effects on you—[conditions](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Condition), [spells](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Spell), [curses](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Curses), and the like—carry over from one form to the other.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ShortRest)Short Rest

A Short Rest is a 1-hour period of downtime, during which a creature does nothing more strenuous than reading, talking, eating, or standing watch. To start a Short Rest, you must have at least 1 Hit Point.

**_Benefits of the Rest._** When you finish the rest, you gain the following benefits:

**Spend Hit Point Dice.** You can spend one or more of your Hit Point Dice to regain [Hit Points](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#HitPoints). For each Hit Point Die you spend in this way, roll the die and add your Constitution modifier to it. You regain Hit Points equal to the total (minimum of 1 Hit Point). You can decide to spend an additional Hit Point Die after each roll.

**Special Feature.** Some features are recharged by a Short Rest. If you have such a feature, it recharges in the way specified in its description.

**_Interrupting the Rest._** A Short Rest is stopped by the following interruptions:

- Rolling [Initiative](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Initiative)
- Casting a spell other than a cantrip
- Taking any damage

An interrupted Short Rest confers no benefits.

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Size)Size

A creature or an object belongs to a size category: Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. A creature’s size determines how much space the creature occupies in combat. An object’s size affects its [Hit Points](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#HitPoints). _See also_ “[Breaking Objects](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BreakingObjects)” and chapter 1 (“[Combat](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Combat)”).

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Speed)Speed

A creature has a Speed, which is the distance in feet the creature can cover when it moves on its turn. _See also_ “[Climbing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Climbing),” “[Crawling](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Crawling),” “[Flying](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Flying),” “[Jumping](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Jumping),” “[Swimming](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Swimming)” and chapter 1 (“[Combat](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#MovementandPosition)”).

**_Special Speeds._** Some creatures have special speeds, such as a [Burrow Speed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BurrowSpeed), [Climb Speed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ClimbSpeed), [Fly Speed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#FlySpeed), or [Swim Speed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#SwimSpeed), each of which is defined in this glossary. If you have more than one speed, choose which one to use when you move; you can switch between the speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can’t use the new speed during the current move. For example, if you have a Speed of 30 and a Fly Speed of 40, you could fly 10 feet, walk 10 feet, and leap into the air to fly 20 feet more.

**_Changes to Your Speeds._** If an effect increases or decreases your Speed for a time, any special speed you have increases or decreases by an equal amount for the same duration. For example, if your Speed is reduced to 0 and you have a Climb Speed, your Climb Speed is also reduced to 0. Similarly, if your Speed is halved and you have a Fly Speed, your Fly Speed is also halved.

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Telepathy)Telepathy

Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a creature to communicate mentally with another creature within a specified range. Unless a rule states otherwise, the contacted creature doesn’t need to share a language with the telepath to understand this communication, but the contacted creature must be able to understand at least one language or be telepathic itself to understand.

A telepath doesn’t need to see a contacted creature, and the telepath can start or end the telepathic contact at any time (no action required). Telepathic contact can’t be initiated and is immediately broken if either the telepath or the other creature has the [Incapacitated](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#IncapacitatedCondition) condition. Telepathic contact is also broken if the contacted creature is no longer within the telepathy’s range or if the telepath contacts a different creature within range.

A creature without telepathy can receive telepathic messages but can’t initiate a telepathic conversation. Once a telepathic conversation starts, the non-telepath can communicate mentally to the telepath until the telepathic connection ends.

---

### [](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#Teleportation)Teleportation

Teleportation is a special kind of magical transportation. If you teleport, you disappear and reappear elsewhere instantly, without moving through the intervening space. This transportation doesn’t expend movement unless a rule tells you otherwise, and teleportation never provokes [Opportunity Attacks](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#OpportunityAttack).

When you teleport, all the equipment you’re wearing and carrying teleports with you. If you’re touching another creature when you teleport, that creature doesn’t teleport with you unless the teleportation effect says otherwise.

If the destination space of your teleportation is occupied by another creature or blocked by a solid obstacle, you instead appear in the nearest unoccupied space of your choice.

The description of a teleportation effect tells you if you must see the teleportation’s destination.

Instead of using a weapon to make a melee attack, you can use a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow. In game terms, this is an Unarmed Strike—a melee attack that involves you using your body to damage, grapple, or shove a target within 5 feet of you.

Whenever you use your Unarmed Strike, choose one of the following options for its effect.

**_Damage._** You make an [attack roll](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#AttackRoll) against the target. Your bonus to the roll equals your Strength modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus. On a hit, the target takes Bludgeoning damage equal to 1 plus your Strength modifier.

**_Grapple._** The target must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (it chooses which), or it has the [Grappled](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#GrappledCondition) condition. The DC for the saving throw and any escape attempts equals 8 plus your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus. This grapple is possible only if the target is no more than one size larger than you and if you have a hand free to grab it.

**_Shove._** The target must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (it chooses which), or you either push it 5 feet away or cause it to have the [Prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#ProneCondition) condition. The DC for the saving throw equals 8 plus your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus. This shove is possible only if the target is no more than one size larger than you.
