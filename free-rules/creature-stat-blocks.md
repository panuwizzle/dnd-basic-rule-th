# Creature Stat Blocks

This appendix provides stat blocks for creatures mentioned elsewhere in the book, particularly in the class, equipment, and spell chapters. See the [rules glossary](/free-rules/rules-glossary#StatBlock) for how to read a [stat block](/free-rules/rules-glossary#StatBlock), and see the _Monster Manual_ for even more creatures.

The following stat blocks are presented in alphabetical order. When the Dungeon Master uses a stat block, the DM may change details in it.
